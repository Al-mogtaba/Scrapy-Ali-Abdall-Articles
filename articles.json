    "article_body": "Back in 2013, my friends and I set up a business whilst we were medical students called 6med. It began as a course for one of the medical school admissions tests called the B-MAT. We had all been on similar courses that just hadn’t been very good and had been very expensive – we thought that we could do a better job, for less money as well as give out places to students from low income backgrounds and so we resolved to set up 6med.\nWhen we started we thought it would just be a small-scale, local project – but I suggested that we make a website and try to market it nationally. Skip forward a few months and we’d run 5 sold-out courses to over 120 students and the following year we expanded into the UKCAT course and began assisting with Medical School interviews. After that we established a question bank for the BMAT and the UKCAT and expanded our locations – even teaching a course in Singapore, Hong Kong, Netherlands.\n\nAll this experience, as well as all the advice that I have read or heard, has given me some useful insights that I want to share with you in this post:\n1..Don’t Wait For Permission\nWhen we’re thinking of starting something we’re often waiting for someone to give us permission or a certificate to say that we’re allowed to start. But waiting is not going to help. In most realms of business, you can start doing it whenever you want and, in fact, the act of ‘doing’ is the best form of learning. If you’re providing a good service that’s all the qualifications you need.\nThe stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you…if it’s important to you and you want to do it ‘eventually’ just do it and correct course along the way Tim Ferriss\n2. Stand on the Shoulders of Giants\nEntrepreneurship and business are not new phenomena. It’s a well-trodden path and in the last few decades we’ve seen an influx of books, podcasts, websites, articles, interviews and a plethora of other resources with people who have set up their own businesses or started their own growth projects. These people have shared what they know and given us really useful resources.\nFrom the 4-Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss to the website IndieHackers which has interviews with founders of successful internet businesses to Paul Graham’s website which has articles and essays about how to get started to Seth Godin’s podcast StartUp School…there is so much stuff out there that we would be foolish not to use it!\n3. Learn to Code\nIt might sound slightly cliched now but knowing the basics of how to code is really valuable. I’ve found it helpful for two key reasons:\n\nKnowing how to code opens your mind up to potential business ideas – it enables you to know the realms of possibility, what can be done.\nWhen you have an idea you can turn it into a business by yourself without having to bring in someone who knows how to code. With my own business, if I hadn’t known how to code, we wouldn’t have expanded online. The ability to create a website is what allowed it to become a national and then international business.\n\n4. Learn Design Basics\nThis might sound like quite a simple concept but learning the basics of design and familiarising yourself with what web design works effectively is very helpful. I think one of the reasons our business was able to grow was because our website looked eye-catching and legitimate. By developing your eye for design, you can add production value which has benefits for a vast array of things in life as well as business. One resource that I’ve found particularly helpful in this regard is Muz.li – a browser extension on Google Chrome – take a look.\n5. Do it with Friends\nThere’s a classic saying in start-ups:\nIf you want to go fast, you should go alone; if you want to go far, you should go together.\nI’ve found this to be completely true – it’s much more enjoyable to undertake projects with people rather than try to go alone on a project. Working with friends makes the whole experience of running a business that much more enjoyable and enables you to problem solve collectively as well as get a variety of opinions as to what people think will work best which will improve the quality of the product too.\n6. Start Small\nIt’s far too easy at the idea stage of a business to get ahead of yourself, overloading features and ultimately becoming overwhelmed very quickly and not getting anything off the ground. It’s far better to concentrate on the basics and your MVP – Minimum Viable Product – which is the smallest version of your product that you can feasibly get in front of people. It’s important to start off really small and, over time, using user feedback, add more iterations and improve the product in small ways. I had the same attitude towards starting my YouTube channel – I recognised that the first 50 – 100 videos were probably going to be terrible but I used everything that I learned in making them to improve over the long term.\n7. Do Things that Don’t Scale\nThis might initially sound counterintuitive. What I mean by this, is not that you should design a product that won’t scale but when you are starting out, undertake actions that won’t scale to ensure customer satisfaction as well as build your customer base. This advice originated from an essay by Paul Graham and the main idea is that at the start you want to be putting in extra effort to make your customers happy and recruit new customers. The extra physical effort initially can help things to snowball and lead to rewards further down the line – take AirBnB. The team initially went round to every listing in New York and offered to take professional photos of the apartments and rooms listed. Another example is Wufoo who wrote handwritten thank you cards to all their customers in the first few years of business.\nWhen we started 6med I did a similar thing – I would email any new customer to give them more information as well as check to see if they had any questions at all about the medicine application process and studying they could reply to that email and we would get back to them. This pleasantly surprised many of our customers and probably helped improve our aura of reliability and honesty.\n8. Expect, and Learn From, Failure\nThe truth is, the chances are very small that your start-up will succeed. It’s the hard truth. BUT failures are valuable – you can learn from your mistakes as well as improve for future projects. I had 5 failed business ideas at secondary school but it was going through those failures and learning from them, that enabled me to ultimately come up with the idea of a BMAT crash course which led to 6med. If you treat failure as a learning opportunity instead of an outright rejection of your product, that will set you up for success further down the line.\n9. Ask Yourself Why\nWe should regularly ask ourselves why we are really doing what we have decided to do. I read a book in 2016 by Derek Sivers, one of the three books that changed my life, called Anything You Want – 40 Lessons for a new kind of Entrepreneur. In this book, he talks about lessons for entrepreneurs that he gained from a company called CD Baby that he set up in the late nineties and sold 10 years later. There’s a quote that I remind myself of every time I become too transfixed by issues or numbers or anything stressful about the business and it always brings me back down to earth and into reality – making me focus on what really matters in life. The quote is:\nNever forget why you are really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?\n10. Just Start  \nIf you’re interested in entrepreneurship – and if you’ve read this far then you probably are (!) – the best thing you can do is just start. We can spend too long being fearful of being judged or, as with the first piece of advice, waiting for permission. Waiting achieves nothing. It’s good to use all the sources I’ve mentioned and read up about business and start-ups but don’t think that that’s a substitute for actually doing your own thing. You only really start to learn when you start to ‘do’! Remember the quote from Tim Ferriss:\nSomeday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you…if it’s important to you and you want to do it ‘eventually’ just do it and correct course along the way\nSo, what are you waiting for?"

    "article_body": "There was once a pottery teacher called Brian. One month, he decided to split his class into two groups. Group A had to make a pot every day for 30 days (so 30 pots in total). Group B had to work on a single pot for the whole 30 days.\nAt the end of the month, Brian judged the quality of the pots. Without exception, every one of the top 10 pots came from Group A, the guys that made one pot per day. None came from the group that focused on perfecting their single pot.\n\nI’ve had messages from students interested in starting various things – YouTube channels, blogs, photography, video editing, all sorts. They’ve been asking for advice on how to get started, or how to improve.\nMy advice is to always focus on quantity over quality, at least for the first few years.\nWant to get better at photography? Take 10,000 photos. Learning how to cook? Try 100 recipes. Video editing? Make 100 videos. At the end of that (and with a few YouTube tutorials sprinkled in for good measure), it’s hard to not be significantly better.\nAiming for quantity has another benefit – it stops the fear of what if this isn’t good enough? from paralysing us. We accept that as beginners, we’re going to suck and that’s okay. In my very first vlog, I said ‘I know my first 50 videos are going to be terrible’. For those 50 videos, that mantra was in the back of my mind. I tried my best to improve my video-making skills, but I never let the pressure of this has to be good get in the way of churning out content. And I’m so so glad that I heard this advice before I got started with YouTube, because without it, I’d still be obsessing over trying to make my first video ‘perfect’ before putting it online.\nSo if you’re starting a new hobby over summer, or trying to improve your skills at pretty much anything, this is something I hope you’ll find useful. I certainly have \nPS: I think the original source of the pottery story is the book Art &amp; Fear. Never read it but I’ve heard good things.\nThis post originally appeared as part of my weekly email newsletter. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

    "article_body": "If you’re starting or growing your YouTube channel, you’ve probably heard the phrase gear doesn’t matter. This is true, to an extent. You don’t need fancy camera equipment to succeed on YouTube. But there’s no denying that production value does help. It’s not the most important thing, but if your videos can look and sound good, you’re stacking the deck in your favour. So in this article, we’re going to take a look at different YouTube gear for different budgets.\nAs such, this page is your ultimate YouTube gear guide for different budget levels – enjoy \n\nBasic Setup\nAudio\nVideo\nLighting\nEditing\n\n\n\n1. Basic Setup\n\n\nIf you’re just getting started on YouTube and you’re not trying to blow up as quickly as possible, don’t worry about gear.\nAs a total beginner, you can get away with using your phone and propping it up on a stack of books. More advanced gear only really matters as you get more comfortable with YouTube and want to take your channel to the next level.\nSo, if you’re thinking YouTube is cool and I’m going to try this out for a little bit, my advice is to make some basic videos using a phone and get comfortable with being a YouTuber. And you should be able to produce something pretty reasonable doing this:\n\nIf you later decide that we want to begin taking YouTube super seriously, then that’s the time to double down and invest in better gear. Starting with audio.\n2. Audio\nAudio’s the most important part of video quality and the very first thing you should upgrade.\nThe problem is that the mics built into our cameras and phones are garbage. So the key to good audio quality is to buy an external mic and have it as close to your mouth as possible. A $100 mic will sound better 10cm from your mouth than a $5000 mic 100cm from your mouth.\n Beginner Audio Setup – External mic with normal mic cable\nLevel 1: Lavalier Mic ($20-40) – Start with a cheap Lavalier microphone and plug it into your phone / camera. This video explains how to do this nicely and gives some good recommendations. Lav mics are great for when you’re moving around (eg: my apartment tour video) or when you’re on a super tight budget. But, I personally wouldn’t use a Lavalier microphone as they’re annoyingly visible and lots of things can go wrong with them.\nLevel 2: Rode VideoMicro ($50-70) – As soon as possible, graduate to a shotgun mic like the Rode VideoMicro, and use any cheap microphone stand to get it as close to your mouth as possible while staying out of frame. Do what this guy does. You can use a mic extension cable (like this one) to plug it into your phone / camera, or you can use an external video recorder (eg: Tascam DR05) and sync audio in post (in post means during post production, which means during your editing phase). Check out my Skillshare class on editing for more about how to sync audio (it’s super easy).\nLevel 2.5: Rode VideoMic Pro+ ($250) – You can replace your Rode Videomicro with something like the Rode Videomic Pro+. That’s what I used for over a year. You can still use your standard thin mic cable to plug it straight into your camera, or into an external recorder. I was using this microphone setup from the start of my channel until June 2019 (250k subs). Whether this upgrade is worth it is genuinely debatable.\nCheck out this video and see if you can tell a difference between the Rode Video Micro and the Rode Videomic Pro. I can, personally. But it’s up to you.\n\n Advanced – External mic with XLR cable and recorder\nWhen you’re ready to upgrade your audio, the next level involves getting an XLR microphone. All the pro mics use XLR (a thick audio cable) rather than the tiny thin microphone ones. The issue is that most non-cinema cameras don’t have XLR audio input, so you’re going to have to record audio separately. To get around this issue we have the following setup:\n\nXLR Microphone ($200 – 800 ish)\nAlthough it doesn’t really matter which XLR microphone, I’ve found these to be pretty good:\nLevel 1: Rode NTG4+ ($230) – The Rode NTG4+ is what I’ve mainly been using since June 2019 and has a decent price to quality ratio. However, there are loads of great XLR microphones out there and it doesn’t really matter which one you use. So hunt around and check out the comparison videos on YouTube. This one by DSLR Video Shooter is very good.\nLevel 2: Sennheiser MKH 416 ($800) – The Sennheiser MKH 416 is what most pro YouTubers use (eg: MKBHD, Peter McKinnon etc) and I also decided to buy one in December 2020. If you’re interested, check out this video where I compare the audio between the two XLR microphones:\n\nExternal Audio Recorder ($150 – 800 ish)\nYou won’t notice much difference at different price points here. Just find something that has XLR input if we’re keen to use an XLR microphone (ie a fancy one).\nLevel 1: Zoom H5 XLR ($230) – the Zoom H5 XLR is the one that I was using from June 2019 to Dec 2020. I’ve also been using it for my Podcast, Not Overthinking. I would’ve stuck with it, but in Dec 2020 I switched to the XLR-K3M just so that I wouldn’t have to record audio and video separately. Here’s a great video review about the Zoom H5.\nLevel 2: XLR-K3M ($800) – Sony cameras now have the XLR-K3M available, which is an external audio recorder that sits directly on top of the camera and plugs into the hot shoe mount. This means you can run an XLR cable straight into your camera to avoid having to use an extra external recorder. This massively reduces friction in the production process so I now use this (from Dec 2020) for my YouTube videos. Here’s a great video by Gerald Undone reviewing it.\nLevel 3: Mix Pre 3 XLR ($800) – the Mix Pre 3 XLR is the gold standard for external audio recorders. It’s what MKBHD uses. I personally don’t think this is necessary, but there are videos online to learn more about it.\n\nIf you want to find out more about the different gear I’ve used throughout my YouTubing journey, check out my gear page. Feel free to also explore these other useful resources about audio setup too:\n\n10 TIPS to Improve AUDIO in Your Videos\nBest Video XLR Shotgun Microphone\nWhich Boom Mics Do I Use? 2020 Edition\nMICROPHONES… Here’s what you need to know\nBest Cheap Mic for YouTube under $50\n\n3. Video\nOnce you’ve sorted our audio, it’s time to think about your camera and lens.\n Camera\nLevel 1: Phone ($0) – if you’re just starting out on YouTube your phone works as a pretty good camera. This video from me explains how you can film YouTube videos on your smartphone. But if you want to take YouTube seriously, you’re going to need an actual camera.\nLevel 2: Canon M50 ($500) – the Canon M50 (Crop Frame) is a great budget camera. It doesn’t shoot in 4k, but this isn’t really a problem as it still shoots in 1080p. I still export some of my own videos in 1080p, so don’t let this put you off.\nLevel 3: Sony A6400 ($900) – the Sony A6400 (Crop Frame) is another solid choice. Like the Canon M50, this camera is a crop frame (otherwise known as APS-C). Crop frame cameras have smaller senses so don’t look quite as good as full frame cameras – check out this excellent video by Becki and Chris explaining the difference. This video also gives you a nice comparison between the Canon M50 and the Sony A6400.\nLevel 4: Sony A7c ($1700) – the Sony A7c (Full Frame) is the camera I’d recommend if we’ve got $2000 to spare. As a full frame camera there’s a big bump in quality compared to the crop frame cameras above.\nLevel 5: Sony A7Siii ($3800) – the Sony A7Siii (Full Frame) is the camera I currently use. It’s an amazing camera, but if you’re going to splash out I’d say go for the A7c. Unless you’ve literally got money to burn. Check out this comparison video if you’re still not sure.\n\n Lens\nLevel 1: Phone ($0) – again, at the most basic level, your phone’s camera and lens will be enough.\nLevel 2: Kit Lens ($0) – if you’ve got a camera, the kit lens that comes with it will be absolutely fine for most things. This is a great video showing how good your video can look with a relatively cheap camera (Canon M50) and its kit lens.\nLevel 3: Sigma 16mm f1.4 ($300) – the Sigma 16mm f1.4 (Crop Frame) is (in my opinion) the best lens you can get for a crop-sensor camera, if you’re making ‘sit down and talk to camera’ style videos. I usually aim for a focal length between 16-35mm. I like the 16mm lens because it means I can be quite close to the camera, giving my videos a more ‘intimate’ feel and I achieve that appealing blurred background effect (AKA bokeh / depth of field). The lower the f number (e.g. f1.4) also helps increase the background blur. My highest performing video was shot using this lens:\n\nLevel 4: Sony 24mm f1.4 ($1600) – once you’ve made the jump to full-frame cameras, you’re going to need full-frame (read: super expensive) lenses too. The Sony 24mm f1.4 (Full Frame) is a solid choice, and I’ve been using this and the Sony 16-35mm f2.8 for some time.\nLevel 5: Sony 16-35mm f2.8 ($2300) – if I could only use 1 lens for the rest of my life it would be the Sony 16-35mm f2.8 (Full Frame). It’s incredibly versatile because it can zoom. 16mm is great for vlogging and chatting to the camera and 35mm is great for B-roll.\n\nOver the last few years I’ve built up quite a collection of different cameras and lenses, which you can check out for yourself on my gear page.\n4. Lighting\nAs a beginner, the natural light through your window is probably enough. But, the ultimate lighting setup involves:\n\nA Dimmable LED Light\nA Soft Box, and\nA light Stand (i.e. a C stand)\n\nI refer to this whole setup as having a big-ass light. Having a big-ass light makes such a difference to your video quality. In fact, even when I’m travelling and need to conserve space, I still bring my big-ass light with me because it makes such a huge difference to any studio setup.\nSome of the pros say you need a back light and a fill light too, but I don’t think it’s necessary or does enough to improve video quality.\n\n Dimmable LED Light\nLevel 1: Random light box ($50) – if you’re just starting on YouTube, a random photography light box (like this) from Amazon may be enough. This video explains more. I used one of these cheap lights from June 2017 until September 2018 (65k subs). But, in hindsight, I wish I’d shelled out a bit more for Level 2 at the start. It would’ve made a huge difference to my video quality.\nLevel 2: Godox SL60W ($120) – the Godox SL60W is what I’d recommend to most people due to its decent price and quality. I use this as my main key light above my desk (it’s ceiling-mounted). I could replace it with one of the options below, but it does the job fine and I don’t think it would make any difference. This video was shot using the SL60W:\n\nLevel 3: Godox VL150 ($400) – the Godox VL150 is also very, very good. Check out this video by Gerald Undone which compares it favourably to the Aputure 120D.\nLevel 3.5: Aputure 120Dii ($800) – Aputure used to be the gold-standard of lighting. It still sort-of is, but they charge a premium for the brand, and Godox is doing a very good job of making identical lights for half the price. Aputure is sort-of like Apple, and Godox is sort-of like OnePlus.\n Soft Box\nOkay, so now that you’ve got a big-ass light, you need a soft box to make the light softer. By default, the light that comes out of our LED light is very harsh, so a large soft box will make the light look more natural and flattering. The soft box will also make up the bulk of your lighting setup (the lights themselves are usually pretty small).\nLevel 1: Space Light or Light Dome ($50) – If you need to light a very tight space, a space light soft-box might be best. I use the Aputure Space Light ($50) mounted to the ceiling above my desk. It’s amazing, and a great way to light videos if you’re up against a wall. Here’s a picture to show you what I mean. I also show it off in my Apartment Tour 2020 video (I’ve linked the appropriate timestamp for your convenience):\n\nIf you’ve got a bit more space, a light dome is probably best. This is what we think of when we think ‘studio lights’. The Neewer Softbox ($50) or Godox Softbox ($50) are both amazing.Level 2: Aputure Light Dome ($250) – the Aputure Light Dome ($250) is the gold-standard brand. Therefore, they’re priced at a premium. The Light Dome II is what I use with my 120D LED light for most lighting situations.\nLevel 2: Aputure Light Dome ($250) – the Aputure Light Dome ($250) is the gold-standard brand. Therefore, they’re priced at a premium. The Light Dome II is what I use with my 120D LED light for most lighting situations.\n Light Stand\nTo use your light and soft-box you need a light stand. Just search Amazon for light stand or C stand and pick anything that’s cheap and has good reviews. It doesn’t really matter what you use. Once this is all setup, you just position the light 45 degrees from your face, elevate it about 35% so it’s pointing down at you, and you’re ready to start filming.\nOther than that, you can use practical lights in the backgrounds to add some visual interest and create the right atmosphere. My practical lights are about 5800-6000 kelvin, but sometimes I use blue lighting in the background (10,000 kelvin).\n5. Editing Resources\nThe final (and least important) part of improving your video production quality is the editing.\n Video Editing\nAs a beginner, the free editing software on your laptops (such as iMovie) is enough to do some basic edits to your videos and get them on to YouTube. But if you’re looking to do something more advanced, then you’re going to have to invest in paid software like Final Cut Pro or Premiere Pro.\nUsing this software, the three edits that will make the most difference are:\n\nTighter a-cuts – whenever we hear a pause in a video it sounds weird, so you want to minimise them.\nTitles, lower thirds &amp; transitions – these make your video more engaging, easier to follow, and are useful ways to include branded elements. I buy all my titles, lower third, and transitions from Videohive.\nSubtle sound effects – sound effects can massively elevate your production value when used subtly. They make your videos feel polished. I tend to use a sound effect whenever something appears on the screen.If you’re interested in learning how I edit my videos, I made a video editing Skillshare class that’s totally worth watching.\n\n Background Music\nIf you’re just talking to the camera, having a bit of background music is another brilliant way to up the production value. It makes such a big difference to the vibe of your video as long as (again) we keep it fairly subtle. I like to use relaxing or acoustic music, which I download from Epidemic Sound – this is totally worth it. Just be careful that you keep the background music at a level that doesn’t interfere with the main audio because then it becomes distracting and detracts rather than adds to the video itself!\nConclusion\nAs I mentioned at the start, if you’re a beginner you can ignore a lot of this information for now. Just start making videos and uploading regularly to YouTube.\nIf you’re ready to invest more time, energy, and money into your YouTube journey then gear is a great way to improve your odds of success. And this article has hopefully been a useful overview of the gear I use and recommend.\nIf you want to find out even more information then I’d also recommend checking out Peter McKinnon, Gerald Undone, and DSLR Video Shooter. Their channels are packed full of useful information.\nIf you’re super keen, you can sign up to my live course – the Part-Time YouTuber Academy – where I chat about my gear in more depth and answer basically any other questions you may have about cameras, audio, lighting, and other useful equipment. You can also read my Ultimate Guide To YouTube article where I go in-depth on everything you need to know about getting started on YouTube."

    "article_body": "A business can’t stay the same. It’s either growing or declining. A small business that is declining is already dead many months, even a year, before its employees know it. – James Altucher\nThere’s something that’s been playing on my mind for the past few months, so I thought I’d put this post together to pseudo-rationally hash it out. It’s slightly related to my previous post about competitor anxiety. The question of the month is – should we continue to grow 6med, or should we allow it to gracefully decline (read: die)?\nWe’re always taught to open with the conclusion, and then argue the point all the way through an essay, so I’m going to do the same here – I think we should allow 6med to decline, and be totally and wonderfully happy with that.\nWord of Warning: This is an enormously self-centred post (but hey, personal blogs often are), written primarily to make myself feel better about a route of action that I’m inclined to take. If it gets too much, please feel free to stop reading \nWhat is 6med?\nTo recap briefly, 6med is the company that some friends and I set up in our 2nd year of medical school, through which we run courses for medical school entrance exams. Over the past 3 years, the company has grown rather nicely, from 110 students in year 1, to 1,100 in year 2, to 1,800 in year 3, with 6-figure revenues and 5-figure tax bills. We’ve given bursaries to hundreds of students, we’ve launched 3 online products (BMAT Ninja, UKCAT Ninja, and The Doctor Project), and we’ve taught BMAT, UKCAT and Interview courses throughout the UK, and also in Amsterdam, Singapore and Hong Kong, all while doing our Medicine degrees at university.\nAll of that sounds pretty cool (at least to me), but this year, our student numbers have declined and (perhaps because of that, but perhaps not) I’ve found myself thinking philosophically about the point of the business, and discussing in my head (and with a few close friends) whether it’s worth putting in the time and effort to grow the company further.\nThe Status Quo\nIf we do nothing else, but continue to run the courses for however many students want to attend them, and continue to maintain our online products, we’ll still get reasonable numbers of students for the next few years at least, but inevitably, we’ll have fewer and fewer students each year as competitors spring up and out-advertise us.\nThis is the path that I’m inclined to take with the company, and what I’ll be arguing for in this post – that a graceful decline is the way forward.\nTo make the case that a graceful decline is the way to go, I’ll be considering a few things. I’ll be suggesting some ways as to which we could grow the company, and then move on to talk about the benefits and costs of growing the company. I’ll argue that the costs outweigh the benefits, and so a graceful decline is the way forward.\nHow we might grow\nI’ve been thinking about this for the past year now, and here are some things I’ve come up with:\n\nGetting our courses and products into schools (private schools especially)\nStarting one-to-one private tuition, possibly into very high-paying clientele\nOnline ad campaigns on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other sites (as some of our competitors are doing)\nOnline brand presence on TSR\nPartnering with more organisations\nWriting more blog posts and articles to improve our SEO (search engine optimisation)\n\nSo there are definitely things that we could be doing. Further, we’ve had a few emails from older students at medical school asking about doing OSCE courses, or medical school finals courses. Interestingly, a few years ago, I actually bought the domain oscecrashcourse.com thinking that it might be on the cards.\nI say all this to show that there are definitely directions in which the company could grow/expand, but I’m now going to talk about the benefits and costs of this expansion and ultimately hopefully argue that the benefits don’t justify the costs.\nBenefits of Growth\nAt the risk of sounding like a douche, there’s no getting around the fact that the main benefit of growth is money. As the company grows and we get more students for our courses and online products, our revenues increase, our profits rise, and ultimately, our teachers and directors get more money in our pockets.\nI suppose we also get to ‘help more people’ get into medical school, but to tout that as a benefit of growth is disingenuous, given that it’s very much a side-effect of our business rather than its primary raison de continuer.\nCosts of Growth\nTrying to grow the company has been, and will be, quite time-consuming. Our competitors and partners in the field have, for the most part, turned their companies into full-time jobs with receptionists and admin staff, and if we want to compete on the same level, we’d have to put in an enormous amount of time to do so.\nMy argument is that there’s no point in us putting such time into growing the company, because, quite simply, it’s no longer enjoyable. 3 years ago, when 6med was first starting out, it was immensely enjoyable (from my perspective at least) to spend the summers building websites, handling customer support, building up our course materials, etc. I had a real sense of purpose in building the company up, and for the first couple of years, it was a lot of fun.\nBut now, 3 years on, doing the same thing again and again is no longer fun. Sure, teaching courses is a good laugh, but my heart sinks at the thought of having to do admin and website maintenance now. Sadly, further growth in the company won’t come from simply teaching more courses – it’ll come from the dull, admin-type jobs like advertising and contacting schools etc etc. None of that is particularly enjoyable, and so I’d rather not do it if there’s a choice.\nTime vs Money\nThe choice ultimately comes down to whether it’s worth putting in time and effort that isn’t particularly fun, with the main purpose of making more money.\nFirstly, as has been quoted ad infinitum on most entrepreneur blogs, time is our most valuable non-renewable resource. More money can always be made later, but the time spent (wasted?) doing things that are not worthwhile, and that we don’t enjoy, is time that will never again be brought back.\nSecondly, it’s also important to take into account the ‘opportunity cost of time’. Spending (let’s say) 8 hours a week trying to expand an existing business has no long-term benefit, given that the mechanisms for expansion are tedious and won’t help us learn anything that we haven’t already learned from the last 3 years of running the company. Those 8 hours a week would surely be far better spent learning some new skills, working on a new business idea, or even ‘just’ spending time with friends. Time and energy spent on the existing business is time and energy that could be put to ‘better’ uses that could provide longer-term benefit/opportunity.\nThirdly, any money we’d make at this age, with this particular business, would most likely be insignificant compared to the money that we’d (hopefully) make in later life as doctors/surgeons/whatever. Seems an awful shame to waste time and energy on dull activities purely for the sake of money, especially when that money will be small change compared to future earnings in ‘proper’ jobs.\nFinally, given the hugely privileged position that we’re all in, from middle-class households with student loans and financial support from our families, it doesn’t make sense to sacrifice time and enjoyment for the sake of additional money at this stage in life. Our family support, supplemented with 6med stuff, means that money isn’t a limiting factor in our university experience (within reason). Excess money from growing 6med would go towards only something like getting on the property ladder slightly quicker than our peers, and that’s personally not something I’m willing to trade my time for.\nConclusion and Parting Advice\nHaving spent the last few months thinking about this, I think I’ve come up with a general-purpose ‘rule’ that I’m going to apply to the rest of my university life whenever I’m faced with a choice (like this).\nIf it’s fun, then do it. If it’s not fun, but it’ll provide some long-term benefit, still do it. But if it’s neither fun nor worthwhile, and the only thing to be gained from it is money at the expense of time, then it’s probably the wrong thing to do.\nDerek Sivers (love that guy) has a wonderful quote in his book ‘Anything you Want’:\nNever forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?\nIt is enough. We’ve had a good run with 6med over the past 3 years. We’ve built a company from scratch, we’ve helped people get into university, and we’ve had fun while doing it. We’re massively grateful to have been able to do that, but won’t continue to waste time and energy on competing with other companies for the sake of more money.\nTherefore, we’re going to keep the company going as long as it’s profitable, and we’ll be totally okay with its inevitable and eventual demise."

    "article_body": "When starting a YouTube channel many of us think we need a ton of fancy gear and a super expensive camera before we begin filming. But, in reality, this isn’t necessary.\nIf you’re on a budget or just want to give this YouTube thing a go, all you really need to get started is the camera on your phone. This gives you pretty decent video/audio quality and is more than enough to build an audience. Any extra gear is just a bonus.\nBut even when you’re using your phone camera, there are still a few important things you need to keep in mind if you’re looking to create the best possible videos:\n\nVideo quality\nAudio quality\nLighting\nFraming\nAdditional Equipment\n\n Video Quality\nThis is the most important thing. And, unfortunately, we don’t really get the best video quality with the default camera app on our phone.\nSo, the app that you want to use and that most people recommend to sort this out is called Filmic Pro. The great thing about this app is that you can manually control a lot of the camera settings, which really helps to boost the visual appeal of your videos.\nIn particular, you need to change the following settings:\n1. Frame rate – normally iPhones film in 30 frames per second (FPS). This is just a little bit too smooth and isn’t really the vibe you usually want to be going for (unless you like it, in which case you do you). I normally shoot in a frame rate of 25 FPS, which looks far more cinematic. And hopefully looks quite reasonable when using your phone too.\n\n2. Resolution and Bitrate – this sounds complicated but basically you want to film in 4K resolution, because you might as well and most modern phones offer that. And then you want to crank up the bitrate as high as possible too. On iPhones this is called ‘FiLMiC Extreme’ and on Android I think it may say something like ‘100 Mbps’. This just means there’s more information encoded and takes up a bigger file size, which generally means your videos are going to be higher quality.\n\n3. White balance – you want to set your white balance so it doesn’t vary massively.\n\n4. Shutter speed – finally, there’s this kind of rule with filmmaking that if your frame rate is 25 FPS you want your shutter speed to be double that. So you want your shutter speed to be 1/50 of a second. Essentially, that gives you the best amount of cinematic motion blur, which should hopefully make the video look fairly natural when you’re moving your hands as you talk. If you cranked up the shutter speed really high (like 1/200), it would look a lot more choppy.\n\nThis all sounds complicated, but once you’ve got the settings sorted the first time, you can save them as a preset on Filmic Pro and never have to touch them again. There’s a load of other tutorials on YouTube if this sort of stuff interests you and want to go into more depth. But the most important thing for decent video quality is not using the default camera app and using something like Filmic Pro.\n Audio Quality\nSome people say that audio is even more important than video quality. This is because people will happily sit through a low quality video if the audio is good, but nobody will want to watch your video if the audio is poor. So, even as a beginner, you need to at least think about your audio quality.\nIf you’re just getting started with YouTube, the audio with just your phone isn’t actually too bad. It definitely isn’t the sort of quality where people would be like oh god, that’s garbage, I’m going to turn this off immediately.\nBut if you’re looking for something a little better, using a small microphone like the Rode VideoMicro is a good option. This will set you back about $50 from Amazon. Then you just connect it to your phone using a Rode adapter, which costs about $10.\nHere’s the difference in audio quality between the iPhone’s microphone and the Rode VideoMicro:\n\nHopefully you can see that the Rode VideoMicro sounds a little bit better than the default iPhone microphone. It’s a good option if you’re on a budget and want an easy way to level up your videos.\n Lighting\nEven if you don’t have the money to spend on a full lighting setup, you can just sit next to a window and this will give you some pretty decent lighting. In fact, using my fancy Aputure 120Dii light doesn’t actually make that much difference to the video when compared with sitting next to a good source of natural light:\nWith light\nWithout light\nIf you watched my behind the scenes videos or a video from Peter McKinnon about how to light your videos, it can be quite intimidating seeing these huge, expensive, light domes and stuff. But you really don’t need that to get started. Sure, over time, it’s definitely worth investing in a light. And I’m really glad I spent the $100 for my lighting setup. But as a beginner you can get pretty decent results sitting next to a window.\n Framing\nFraming the shot means getting yourself and your background positioned perfectly, so there’s a nice visual feel to your videos.\nWhen I record with my iPhone, I normally connect it to my MacBook and use QuickTime Player to share/mirror whatever my phone’s recording. As I normally use the normal camera on the back of my phone (as they offer slightly higher quality than the selfie camera), this helps me to easily frame my shot and see exactly what I’m recording.\n\nThat way I also don’t need a fancy monitor, like the SmallHD Focus that I bought for $600. Using QuickTime Player basically does the exact same thing.\n Additional Equipment\nFinally, there’s a couple of extra things you can use to make our videos look fantastic:\n\nExtra lenses – if you want to go for a slightly different look than the standard framing of your phone, you can use an external lens that just screws on top of it. I quite like the extra wide angle iPhone lenses from SANDMARC. I’m not a huge fan of being far from the camera, this wider framing means I can sit a little closer. This helps improve my audio quality too (as I’m also closer to my microphone).\nTripod – I just use a random phone tripod. It really doesn’t matter what you use. The important point is that you can put a cold shoe mount on top, which means you can easily attach your Rode VideoMicro on top when you choose to upgrade your audio. If you’re really ghetto, and you don’t want to spend the money on a tripod, you could prop up your phone on a stack of textbooks instead. That way, there’s never an excuse as to why you’re not getting started on YouTube.\n\nConclusion\nThe main point is that you don’t actually need a lot to start a YouTube channel and begin filming. If you’re on a budget you can do everything on your phone. Then upgrade later when you decide to start taking things a bit more seriously.\nBuying more expensive gear is just one way of stacking the deck in your favour, giving you the best shot at success on YouTube. It isn’t essential to start. Feel free to check out the gear I use on my channel if this sort of thing interests you.\nAnother brilliant way of stacking the deck in your favour is to join a live cohort, where you can learn the systems, strategies, and tools that helped other YouTubers to succeed. If this sounds like fun, I run a Part-Time YouTuber Academy where I teach people how to create systems to grow their channel from 0 to 100,000+ subscribers and transform it into a sustainable, income-generating machine.\nAnd if you’re interested in learning more about YouTube and getting started, check out my Ultimate Guide to YouTube."

    "article_body": "Starting a YouTube channel is, hands down, the single best thing I’ve ever done in my life. I’ve met hundreds of incredible people, built an income-generating machine, and enjoyed every step of the way. So in this article I’m going to share my top 10 tips on how to get started on YouTube.\n 1. Don’t worry about what other people will say\nThe number one fear about getting started on YouTube is always the same: I’m worried about what my friends and family will think.\nThis certainly seems like the biggest deal in the world – and it’s a common fear we all have – but the truth is no one actually cares. Everyone’s just too worried about their own lives and you just need to get that into your heads. No one actually cares whether you’re uploading videos to YouTube.\nThere’s this thing in psychology called the ‘Spotlight Effect’, which is the phenomenon that we all walk through life thinking that everyone notices everything about us. And we forget that everyone else is absorbed in their own life and probably not thinking about us at all. So whenever you think it’s going to be embarrassing/scary/awkward to start a YouTube channel, the chances are your friends and family won’t even care.\nYou just need to record your video and hit publish. The fear will quickly disappear.\n 2. Gear doesn’t matter at the start\nAlthough gear does matter in the long run, at the start it doesn’t matter at all.\nWhen I started my YouTube channel I filmed everything using my iPhone. I knew absolutely nothing about editing and just watched a bunch of free YouTube tutorials to help me out. It’s like when you’re learning to write, it doesn’t matter what pen you use as long as you’re writing something.\n\nSo if you want to get started on YouTube, screw the gear. Don’t think, I need to get this fancy camera before I begin. You can start with whatever and upgrade our gear later if you decide to take YouTube more seriously.\nIf you do want to upgrade, my recommendation is to upgrade your audio first. This is because people will happily sit through bad video quality, but nobody wants to sit through bad audio quality. If you want to learn more about exactly which gear to buy at different levels, feel free to check out my article on ‘YouTube Gear for Different Budgets’.\n 3. Don’t worry about the numbers\nOnce you’ve started your YouTube channel, the mistake everyone makes is to focus too much on the analytics. The only thing we really have to do is to just keep on producing video and not really worry about the fact that no one is watching them.\nAccording to TubeBuddy, the average channel with 1k to 10k subscribers has made 152 videos. So until you’ve made 152 videos, you don’t really have the right to complain that you’re not growing on YouTube. Only once you’ve hit this milestone should you begin thinking about how to tweak things to improve your engagement and growth.\nFor me, it took 52 videos and 6 months to hit 1000 subscribers. I was making 2 videos/week while I was a full time medical student at Cambridge preparing for my final year exams. During this time I didn’t even think about the analytics or subscriber count. I focused on creating consistent content and definitely didn’t bother worrying about diving too deep into the stats. The ROI is just way too small when you’re starting out.\n 4. Stack the deck in your favour\nTo succeed on YouTube you want to think in terms of stacking the deck. The extent to which you should stack the deck depends on how you’re thinking about YouTube.\nIf you’re thinking about YouTube purely as a hobby and don’t really care about the numbers, then there’s no point worrying about stacking the deck in your favour. Just have fun. But, if like a lot of students on my Part-Time YouTuber Academy course, you’re thinking about YouTube more as a business opportunity, then stacking the deck in your favour is super important.\nAnd there’s broadly 2 ways of stacking the deck:\n\nTime – this involves putting in the time to learn how to get better at shooting videos and editing them. The more time you put into creating the videos, the better your videos will be. So we’ll get more views, engagement, and subscribers. For example, James Jani grew from 0 to 500k+ subscribers on YouTube within like 10 videos by spending hundreds of hours writing, scripting, and editing every video. He has effectively stacked the deck in his favour by spending large amounts of time on his content.\nMoney – this is more advanced. But the more you invest in gear or hiring people, the better your content will be. You can actually outsource video editing quite cheaply and it’s well worth it if you value your time more than $10 an hour.\n\n 5. Use your unfair advantages\nI’ve got a three-part formula for success on YouTube: Success = work x luck x unfair advantage\n\nWork – if you want to succeed, you need to actually put in the time and effort.\nLuck – the more videos you create, the higher the chances that one of your videos will go viral. In fact, for my channel only like 2 or 3 videos have gone viral in the last 4 years of creating content. So a large part of success is luck.\nUnfair advantage – you want to think about the qualities you have that other people can’t compete with and can use to propel your channel. My unfair advantage, for example, was that I was a medical student at Cambridge university. And if you’re thinking I don’t have an unfair advantage, you should check out my video on the fantastic book The Unfair Advantage, which will help you to figure out this question.\n\n\n 6. Focus on quantity rather than quality\nIt is far more important when you’re starting out on YouTube to make 100 really bad videos than to try and make 10 really good videos.\nThe caveat – you’re going down the James Jani route of spending hundreds of hours editing our videos. But for most people reading this, I’d imagine that the aim is to become a YouTuber where you sit in front of the camera and share your experiences, rather than to craft Netflix level documentaries.\nQuantity &gt; Quality\nThe reason why you should focus on quantity is nicely captured by the parable of the pottery class. The story goes as follows: there’s a pottery class and the teacher divides the class into two groups. One group has to make a pot every day for 30 days and the other group has to focus on making a single pot for the whole 30 days. And then at the end, the teacher judged the quality of the pots and gave a prize to the best potter. Ultimately, every single pot that won a prize came from the quantity group, rather than the quality group.\nIn other words, when you’re starting out with YouTube there’s so much to learn: improving your ability to talk to the camera, improving your editing skills, improving your storytelling, etc. All of these things happen by putting in the reps and making hundreds of videos. By creating lots of content you’re naturally going to improve the quality of your videos without even really thinking about them.\n 7. Don’t really worry about what your niche is\nPeople get very hung up on this and say things like I don’t know what to make videos about. But this thought process is like an artist saying I don’t know what my masterpiece is going to be, therefore I’m not going to bother painting. It’s not going to get you anywhere.\nSure, you can take a very calculating route and plot out your content in advance. But, what I would recommend is to just start making videos about whatever you enjoy – like your favourite pen or some close-up magic – and let your niche emerge over time.\nI never thought I would be a productivity YouTuber, but I seem to have become a productivity YouTuber because that niche just sort of emerged over time. It wasn’t planned out in advance. So don’t overthink it. Just make the videos you enjoy and work this out later.\n 8. Be patient and be consistent\nPatience and consistency are really the only two things that you need for success on YouTube. You need the consistency to publish at least one video a week and the patience to realise that you’re not going to get any traction for a while.\nSuccess on YouTube is absolutely not an overnight thing. For the first 50-100 videos we’re going to make no money. But if you stick with it for 2-3 years, and get that flywheel to turn, you’ll start to see some compounding returns. It’s that consistency that gives you the results.For example, it’s like my goal to get six pack abs. If I were to do some crunches right now and not see my abs straight after, it would be silly for me to say why are my abs not coming out?. Because you have to do it every day for several results before you see any results.\n 9. Try and think about it in terms of systems\nIf YouTube success is largely about being consistent for a very long time, it’s important to build systems that help you to put out one or two videos a week for the next five years. This is something that we teach in our Part-Time YouTuber Academy course, but it’s mainly about answering the following questions:\n\nHow can I generate as many ideas for content as possible?\nHow can I refine these ideas and turn them into titles/thumbnails/hooks?\nHow can I create these videos in parallel?\nHow can I find pockets of time throughout the day to plan out my videos?\nHow should I plan my week so I can film several videos at the same time?\n\nYou should also check out The E-Myth Revisited by Michael Gerber. This is a book I’ve been recommending to all the students in our course, and everyone who’s read it says it’s absolutely amazing. It really helped me to begin thinking in systems. And this is the one thing that’s made publishing on YouTube so much easier for me.\n 10. Just do it\nIf you’re thinking of getting started on YouTube, just do it. Stop reading this article, get out your phone, start speaking, and upload it using the YouTube app. It’s really that simple.\nWe all overthink this way too much. We think oh my god, my first video has to be perfect otherwise nobody is going to watch. But nobody actually cares. Nobody will watch our first few videos anyway. As I said before, until you’ve published like 100+ videos just create and upload anything.\nWhat matters is you actually get started.\nThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. – Chinese Proverb\n Conclusion\nThere’s honestly nothing else you need to do if we want to get started on YouTube. It’s as simple as getting out your phone and committing to the journey.\nIf you’re pretty serious about this YouTube thing, feel free to join me on my live 6-week course, where I teach a few hundred people how to do all this stuff and much more. You don’t need a course to succeed on YouTube, but the accountability/community/etc. is something that many of our previous students have found incredibly useful. And if you’re looking for something more in-depth you can sink your teeth into, you might enjoy my Ultimate Guide to YouTube article.\nAlso check out all the fantastic free resources online. I quite like Think Media and the Video Creators podcast and YouTube channel. This is great stuff and has helped me a ton along the way."

    "article_body": "By the grace of God, 6med is doing alright. Without going into the specifics, we’re at a point where we could potentially make it a full-time thing. We wouldn’t want to, of course, as ‘dropping out of medical school to run a company that does courses for people trying to get into medical school’ doesn’t sound particularly appetising. There’s also probably a point that’ll come very, very quickly where we realise that doing day-to-day admin is super boring and not at all fulfilling. But anyway, what once started as ‘let’s run a handful of courses in the summer holidays to make a bit of cash’ has become something bigger that’s taken over a significant chunk of our lives and identities. And along with the extra customers and revenue have come the anxieties and stresses of running a business while trying to do well in a Medicine degree.\nRecently, I’ve found myself spending more and more time worrying about things related to the business. This is quite atypical – I’m not usually one to feel anxious/stressed about much, so it comes as quite a surprise when I get a feeling of… something… deep down and realise it’s because I was playing through a ‘what if?’ scenario in my head. So this post is mostly a way for me to rationalise away the anxieties associated with running the business. I suppose it might also be helpful for a few people who might be in a similar position, or just somewhat interesting for people who’re interested in setting up a startup/business/whatever and might be intrigued by how it feels to be doing that a few years down the line.\nCompetitor Anxiety\nCompetitor anxiety is probably the biggest one. When 6med was in its fledgling state (back when it was still called ‘Crash Courses’), competitors didn’t worry us in the slightest. We knew we were the newest and youngest kids on the block, and our expectations/hopes for the company were so low that we didn’t care at all that Kaplan were a huge corporation, that Medify was doing well with their online question bank, that Blackstone Tutors had a cool name, that (the now-defunct) BMAT Ready had a (fairly cringeworthy) promo video etc etc. We were totally happy just trying to break into the market and teaching a handful of courses.\nBut then we got bigger, and became (I think) one of the ‘biggest’ companies in this somewhat niche market. If Google page rank means anything, the only company above us for BMAT and UKCAT course-related search terms is Kaplan, and they’ve been around for almost 100 years (not that Google search has, but oh well). We’re quite happy with this position – we’ve accepted that Kaplan are always going to be big, and even though they charge £300+ for their courses, there’s always going to be the market for parents wanting to give their kids the ‘best’ preparation possible. It makes psychological sense for ‘best’ to be associated with ‘most expensive’, even though that’s (almost certainly) not true in reality.\nUnfortunately though, Kaplan aren’t the only competitors. New companies have sprung up in the last few years, with websites that don’t necessarily look like they were designed in the 1990s (which was certainly the case when 6med started up in 2013). Some have even managed to get ‘official partnerships’ with big names like the Royal Society of Medicine, which is quite worrying from our end (and probably quite satisfying from theirs). This rise in competitors within our field is hardly surprising, given that everyone and their dog knows that the barrier to entry is very low, and nowadays anyone can slap together a reasonable-looking website and start advertising their own ‘BMAT preparation course’ or whatever.\nWhy is any of this a problem? Well, the internal reasoning goes as follows: I’m worried that these other companies will overtake ours. Then we’ll get no students for our courses, therefore we’ll lose everything, therefore I’ll end up broke.\n1. I’m worried that other companies will overtake ours\nThe ideal response is probably as follows – So what? Why does it matter if other companies ‘overtake’ ours? Who cares if they get more students than we do? Kaplan probably get more students than we do, but we never get worried about that.\nIn any case, the medical-application-tuition market is big enough that there’s plenty of room for multiple companies. With 25,000 applicants each year, even if we get overtaken (by whatever metric one cares to use) by other companies, we’ll still likely have a reasonable enough market share to be getting along with.\nThat leads us to the next anxiety.\n2. We’ll get no students for our courses\nThis is just clearly wrong. Even if other companies overtake ours, we’ll still likely get a large number of students through word-of-mouth advertising alone. That added to the fact that we’ve got online products like BMAT Ninja and (soon) UKCAT Ninja means that we’ll always have some level of market penetration for our courses. So the fear that we’ll get no students is clearly unfounded. Sure, we might get fewer students, but even if that’s the case, this is still ultimately a part-time thing that we’re doing on the side, along with our Medicine careers. It doesn’t matter at all to us, whether we get 2,000 students a year or 500 – running the business is pretty fun, teaching courses and helping students is pretty fun, and even with 500 students (heck, even with 100) we’d still make a decent amount of money (not that money is a particularly large factor in anything).\n3. We’ll lose everything and end up broke\nOkay, this is slightly exaggerated, but the general sentiment holds true. I’ve already addressed why we’ll get no students is probably not accurate, but for the sake of argument, even if we do end up getting no students, that’s not the end of the world at all. As in the previous bit, it’s important to remember that at the end of the day, this is ‘just’ a side-project that we were super blessed to be able to turn into a decent business. If we get to the point where we do genuinely have zero students signing up for our courses and zero students signing up for our online resources, it’ll be a good time to call it quits and move on to another side project (my brother, some tech-minded friends and I have a shared Wunderlist to-do list that has 20+ reasonable ideas on it). As someone famous once famously said, Don’t be sad that it’s over, be happy that it happened.\nJeffrey Way, the founder of Laracasts (a wonderful resource for learning about the PHP Laravel framework and programming concepts), had an episode of the Laracasts podcast entitled 10 business tips when launching your first app. I was casually listening to the episode while ironing my shirt getting ready for the morning Trauma &amp; Orthopaedics meeting when I heard the following\nThe guilt is the hardest part… You can’t enjoy being with your family, because in the back of your head, you’re thinking oh my gosh, if I stop working on this, then somebody will pass me by, and I’m going to lose everything, and then I’m going to go broke and then I’ll be homeless…\nThe last bit is somewhat jokey, but that bit of the podcast just resonated so much within me. It sounds utterly ridiculous to say ‘I’m going to lose everything, and then I’ll be broke and then I’ll end up homeless’ but that’s sometimes where the thought process can end up going. In those situations, regaining a sense of perspective in a timely fashion is probably the most important thing. Obviously we won’t end up broke or homeless if the business stops functioning – we’re fortunate enough to be born into reasonably well-off families and backgrounds, with degrees from fantastic universities, and we’ll most likely have no trouble finding jobs in the future. As far as privilege goes, there’s literally less than nothing we can complain about. So whenever anything like this thought even remotely crosses my mind, I try to take a step back and think ‘Life is so great right now, thank God. Even if the business ends, I’ll still have a more-than-solid base and will simply move on to the next fun side-project while doing Medicine’.\n\nSo that’s essentially it. Having written this post, I realise that practically all my worries and anxieties about competitors are silly. While these sorts of thoughts will probably still pop into my head from time to time, I now have rational, reasoned responses to them, and so they won’t make me feel quite so bad (if at all). In that sense, the function of this post is fulfilled, and all I can do is hope that you, the reader, found it interesting enough to warrant getting this far."

    "article_body": "One of the many great reasons to start a YouTube channel is to make some money. And perhaps the easiest way for us to do this is to begin displaying ads on our videos (through the Adsense programme). This article explores how you can triple your YouTube Ad Revenue.\nBut how we actually increase the amount of money we make through Adsense isn’t entirely straightforward.\nPeople often think that more views correlates with more money or more subscribers means a higher revenue – but it doesn’t really work like that. It’s not quite so simple.\nAlthough there are many smaller factors that affect the amount of money we make through ads (as we’ll talk about later), I’ve found there are 3 key factors that are most influential:\n\n Watch Time\n⌛ Length of Video\n Type of Content\n\nHow to Begin Showing Ads\nBefore we get to these factors though, we need to make sure we’ve been accepted on to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). This requires us to have at least 1000 subscribers and 4000 public watch hours in the last 12 months.\nOnly once we’ve met these requirements can we begin showing ads on our videos. And these ads typically fall into one of the following 4 categories:\n\nSkippable ads (in-stream) – these are the ads that play before a video (pre-roll) or during the video (mid-roll), and can be skipped after 5 seconds. Google also calls them TrueView in-stream ads as we’ll only be paid when someone chooses to watch the full 30 seconds. As viewing them is optional, we typically get paid more for these type of ads.\nNon-skippable ads (in-stream) – 76% of people will choose to skip ads, so some advertisers run in-stream ads that can’t be skipped by the viewer. These ads are normally 30 seconds long, but advertisers also have the option to run shorter ads (such as 6 second bumper ads).\nVideo discovery ads – formerly known as in-display ads, these ads sit at the top of the result page whenever we search for something on YouTube (kinda like the ads we see at the top of the Google search page). Again, these are also a type of TrueView ad as the user actively decides whether or not to watch them.Non-video ads – finally, these are the image-based ads we see floating above our videos (overlay ads) or in the right sidebar next to our video (display ads). Unlike in-stream ads, we’ll be paid on a cost-per-click basis, which means that we’ll get a few pennies every time someone decides to click on the ad.\n\nSource: Google\nThe 3 Factors that Affect Ad Revenue\n 1) Watch Time\nWhen it comes to making money from our video content, watch time is perhaps the single most important factor. On a very basic level, the longer people watch our videos, the more opportunity they have to see our in-stream ads, which should lead to higher revenues. Pretty simple really.\nFrom an algorithm perspective, watch time is also a fantastic indicator of video quality. If YouTube thinks our videos are decent and keeps viewers on the platform for longer (which is what they’re ultimately trying to achieve), then they’re going to surface our videos more often. Plus, they’ll be far more likely to show ads on our videos as our content is likely to result in more views and clicks for the advertiser.\nGiven that watch time is so important, we need to pay particular attention to our audience retention graphs. The aim being to try and keep our audience engaged for as long as possible. This is harder than you may think:\n\nIf we look at four of my earlier videos, we can see the audience retention graphs are not too impressive, and by the end of the video only 1 in 4 people are watching.\nI’ve been slowly working on trying to move my retention percentage closer to 50% (ish), and sometimes I just think ughh this is completely pointless. But, having seen the awesome results I’ve had from improving retention and watch time in other videos, I think it’s well worth putting in the work to sort it out.\nJust check out the ad revenue of these 2 videos and the impact I’ve had simply by increasing my watch time:\n\n⌛ 2) Video Length\nFor many years, YouTube’s policy allowed creators to have mid-roll ads on any video longer than 10 minutes.\nAs a result, some channels began to artificially inflate the length of their videos to get past the ’10 minute mark’. And although there’s a trade off between putting more ads in videos and retaining audience attention, it had a net positive result and significantly increased their earnings.\nIn fact, my YouTube friend, Shelby Church, actually ran an experiment to see the difference in ad revenue between a video under 10 minutes compared to a longer video over 10 minutes. She found that a video over 10 minutes earned her 3 times more ad revenue than the shorter video.\nRecently, YouTube changed this policy to allow all videos over 8 minutes to add mid-rolls ads. This is awesome news for creators because it makes showing ads on our content even easier, but we’re still likely to see people inflating their video length to reach the ‘8 minute mark’ lol.\nVideo Length Example – My Last Day as a Doctor\nThis video’s length (33:12) is the primary reason it generated such substantial revenue in the first couple of months. And it quickly became the eighth most financially lucrative video that I’ve ever released – outperforming videos with well over 1 million views.\n\n\n\n 3) Type of Content\nFinally, the type of content we create is the third key factor impacting our ad revenue. This is mainly because of the effect it has on our videos’ CPM (cost per mille).\nIn advertising, CPM refers to the cost per 1000 impressions and, for YouTube, this means views. So, let’s say we had a CPM of $10/£10, then the advertiser will pay that much money per 1000 ad views on our video and we’ll take a cut of it. If our CPM was higher, we’d obviously make even more money.\nOur CPM rates ultimately depend on the type of videos we make. You see, advertisers have to bid for advertising slots on YouTube and the amount they pay is determined by the level of competition from other advertisers wishing to show their ads on the same videos – effectively, it’s an auction with the highest bidders getting the best video spots. As a result, advertisers pay different rates for different topics on different channels.\nChannels with videos on subjects like e-commerce, real estate, finance, technology or videos about making money all seem to produce higher CPMs than content such as vlogs, because there is more competition from advertisers to purchase those ad slots and access the audience of those particular videos. So it’s totally worth being selective with your niche and producing content that’s advertiser-friendly if you want to make a decent CPM.\nOn average, how much can we expect to make?\nMost channels average between £2-5 ($3-7) per 1000 views – for instance, my videos only get a little above this ($4-10). But the most profitable topics will earn creators around £30 ($40) per 1000 views. In fact, Shelby Church’s video on how to make money using the Amazon FBA program had an incredible CPM of $35.60. This was a prime video for advertisers to target because it’s a video about e-commerce, technology and making money online – all of which are topics that tend to drive up advertising prices.\nSadly, not all the CPM goes to the creator. YouTube takes a 45% cut of the CPM which means if our CPM was $10, we’d actually only get $5.50. This new value is known as the RPM (Revenue per Mille) and provides a more accurate idea of how much money we’ll make from our videos.\nIf we want to see how much we’re earning from ads, we can find both our CPM and RPM earnings in the YouTube Creator Studio. Here’s what mine look like:\n\nExample – How I Take Notes on my iPad Pro\nThis video has a revenue which amounts to 3x more than any other video on my channel. It has the highest CPM, the highest Watch Time and is well over 10 minutes in length – if anything it’s the perfect combination for a high revenue video.\n\n\nAdditional Factors\nThe above 3 factors have the biggest influence on the amount of money we’re going to make through our YouTube ads. But, they’re not the only factors. There are also some smaller, additional, factors that affect the amount of money we’re likely to make:\n\n Algorithm – although nobody really understands how this works, if we can create content that favours the YouTube algorithm we’ll increase our chances of getting views and recommendations of our content. And subsequently increase our ad revenue. Check out this YouTube Analytics &amp; Growth Masterclass if you’re interested in learning more about this.\n Demand – if more advertisers see that our audience is engaged and within their niche, then there’s going to be more of them bidding for an ad spot on our channel. This bidding drives up the price they pay and, therefore, the amount of money we make. If demand is low, because our content hasn’t got any particular focus, then less advertisers will bid. So we’ll make less money.\n Season – certain topics are more popular at different times of year. For instance, around Christmas time advertisers are more likely to run ads. This is why we usually see our CPM increase in December as advertisers compete for the best ad spots.\n SEO – if we can improve our position in the YouTube search results, we’re going to get more views and better ads shown on our content, which means more money. I’ve found that it can be useful to do some basic SEO, such as targeting keywords (I use Ahrefs for this) and filling out the relevant meta information when uploading my videos.\n Geography – certain countries (e.g. the USA) have populations with far greater spending power compared to others (e.g. India). So, if our audience is mostly from the USA, advertisers are going to bid more to show ads on our content (as our viewers are more likely to buy their products or services).\n Ad-blockers – finally, some people use ad-blockers to stop seeing ads on YouTube. Obviously, if more people have ad-blockers, less people will see the ads running on our content. And we’ll make less money.\n\nThis sounds like a lot, but I’ve noticed that these additional factors are largely just about increasing watch time (i.e. algorithm, season, SEO) and creating the right content (i.e. demand &amp; geography) – two of the three key factors we talked about earlier. So, if anyone’s keen to increase their ad revenue, then there isn’t much point worrying about these additional factors at all. Just focus on finding our niche, building our audience, and keeping them engaged.\nOther than that, it’s important to remember that ads aren’t the only way we can make money through YouTube. Things like sponsorships, affiliate income, and running an online course are all great ways to increase our earnings too. In fact, these additional income streams accounted for 90% of the money I made in 2020 (about £900,000), which is insane.\n\nConclusion\nThere’s no simple way to increase our ad revenue. Many different factors impact the amount of money we’re likely to make. But it largely comes down to increasing watch time, creating longer videos, and being selective with our content type.\nIf there’s one piece of advice I would give it’s to keep everything as simple as possible. Don’t overcomplicate things. If we focus on the process, making small improvements to our channel where we can, then we’re going to head in the right direction and gradually earn more from our ads.Hopefully you found this useful.

We&amp;#039;ve all spent time at some poi…Skillshare\n\n\nFinding the right tools and techniques for learning is difficult. We’ve all spent time at some point searching the internet for the answer to questions like How can we revise effectively, Best methods for studying, How to ace my exams – but often we end up reverting back to what we know and the techniques that we’ve always used or simply get bored with searching and so revert back to procrastinating on Instagram.\nThis class provides an extensive walkthrough of the flashcard app Anki – a tool which has made studying more effective, more efficient and less stressful for thousands of students around the world. The aim of the class is to show that Anki is an immensely powerful tool and by using it, you can start to leverage the benefits of active recall and spaced repetition to improve your own work – whether that be studying for exams or learning new content of any sort. Whether you are a beginner to Anki or you’ve had experience using the app in the past, I hope you can draw some helpful tips, advice and value from these lessons.\nSection One\nIn the first section, we’ll introduce the theory and power of flashcards before guiding you through the basics of Anki – from initial installation to an explanation of the different card types as well as how you can use the app across multiple devices to make sure you keep up with your flashcard reviews. Even if you’ve used Anki in the past, you’ll hopefully still find value in these videos because it’s important to get a solid foundational understanding of the mechanics of Anki before moving further into the app.\nSection Two\nThe second chapter is walkthrough-based and features a series of examples where I’ll share how I would make a flashcard from a lecture, a video as well as how I made flashcards for an essay-based exam during my third year at Medical School. The section finishes with a discussion about the importance of using the Extra section of your flashcards to enhance your understanding and improve your flashcards.\nSection Three\nSection three is structured around frequently asked questions that I’ve received in relation to Anki – not only in terms of the mechanics of the app but also questions around how to maintain motivation, discipline and consistency to avoid becoming overwhelmed with cards to review. There are also a series of videos where I’ll discuss Anki in relation to other apps that people sometimes use for similar learning techniques – including Quizlet, Notion and Google Sheets.\nSection Four\nThe final chapter is more advanced and aimed at the optimisation of Anki through the use of tags, premade decks and a handful of recommended add-ons that will enhance your experience, efficacy and efficiency when using Anki.\nThroughout this class, there’ll be segments from interviews that I recorded with students from around the world and I’d like to thank David, Prerak, Clara, Sanjush, Carter, Kaddor and Liam for offering their time to talk through their own experiences with Anki and how they’ve used it for their own studies.\nWho am I?\nMy name is Ali – I’m a doctor working in the UK, and on the side I make YouTube videos about medicine, tech and productivity. I discovered Anki in my second year at university whilst studying medicine at Cambridge and the app not only had a measurable positive impact on my studies but also helped revolutionise the way that I studied as well.\nFor me, Anki has probably been the most useful and valuable app that I’ve used over the past few years and I want others to be able to get the same benefits that I achieved by discovering it. I often get questions on my videos asking for advice on using Anki as it can be quite a daunting app for beginners, that’s why I’ve decided to put together an extensive Skillshare class which takes you right through from setting yourself up on the app to the more advanced ways that you can optimise it to suit your own needs and get the most from your work."

    ],
    "article_body": "One of the first bottlenecks you’ll probably come to when starting a YouTube channel is the fear of running out of content ideas and idea generation in general. A fear you’ll get to a point where you’ve got nothing new or interesting to offer to your audience.\nWhat if I run out of content ideas?\nAnd this fear is completely legit – I used to worry a lot about running out of ideas during my first year of doing YouTube properly. Especially as I knew the formula for YouTube success involved making decent videos and making them constantly (i.e. 1 video/week for 2+ years).\nEven with an abundance of ideas, that output isn’t easy. But it definitely helps.\nSo figuring out a process for capturing and generating new video ideas is crucial to streamline your content creation process and give you the best opportunity to succeed.\nFortunately, over the past four years of my YouTube journey I’ve done exactly that and it’s what I’m going to share with you now. This process is what I call the ABC method of idea generation:\n\nAsk Your Audience\nBirdsong Technique\nCoal Mining\n\n Ask Your Audience\nYou can’t read the label from inside the bottle\nThis is a nice phrase that my writing coach likes to tell me. In short, when you’re too close to something, you can’t see it.\nWe don’t appreciate our own skill or competence because we’re a very critical observer of our own abilities. As a result, we think that we’re not particularly interesting and nobody is going to take us seriously. This leads to two negative thoughts that destroy our ability to think of ideas and regularly create new content:\n\nImposter Syndrome – when we think we’re not qualified to talk about something, we often hold back from putting ourselves out there.\nFear of failure – when we think our content is likely to perform poorly, we see little point in putting in the effort upfront. This therefore becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nIt’s only when we get out of the bottle we discover how much we have to offer.\nThe best way to do this is by listening to others. Other people have a more objective opinion of our abilities and are happy to tell us what we’re good at. And what they want to learn from us (like how you study or how you type fast etc.). This helps you to discover what sort of content you should be creating.\nAsking your audience then is a fantastic way to get a bunch of new video ideas. The easiest way to do this is to post something on Twitter and Instagram saying something like I want to make a video but need some ideas – what should I make a video about next?. From this, you’ll receive loads of messages from fans literally telling you what they want to see. I now never worry about thinking of video ideas because the worst case scenario is I just ask my audience.\n\nYou might be thinking well, that’s easy for you to say, but even if you’re ‘billy no-mates’ and have no audience yet, it’s still possible to ask for ideas from your friends and family. This is a super easy way to generate a handful of video titles and get your channel flowing with ideas even before that first person subscribes.\n Birdsong Technique\nThe Birdsong Technique comes from the idea that when you spend the time to research and learn about the chirping/warbling of different birds, you start to really appreciate the sounds they make. After a short time you’ll also begin recognising what bird is singing each specific song. Rather than it being some random-ass background sound that most of us hear but ignore.\nSo by understanding the basics of birdsong, it suddenly takes on a whole new colouring. And it’s basically the same with content lol.\nWhen you’re a content consumer, you sort of passively enjoy the things that other people have created. You don’t think anything of it other than this is kinda cool. But as soon as you decide to be the creator, everything shifts. You start consuming content as a creator, and begin thinking how can I use this content in my next video/article.\nSo the birdsong technique is about recognising that all content is great for helping us to generate ideas.\n\nYou can find ideas from lots of different places using this technique. I spend a lot of time on Twitter, listening to podcasts, reading articles on Instapaper, and reading books on my Kindle. And I’m constantly asking myself whether or not there’s some interesting insight that I can use for my next video, article or newsletter. This is great because idea generation becomes a natural part of what I would be doing anyway.\nThere’s just one thing you should keep in mind – if the content you consume is very different from the content you create, something is going wrong. In an ideal world, the stuff you’re consuming would have some correlation to the stuff you’re creating. This makes the whole creation process a lot more streamlined.\n Coal Mining\nThe idea behind Coal Mining is that you are actively looking for ‘hot spots’. And a hot spot is an area where you’re likely to find coal (i.e. video ideas) if you start digging. This coal can then be used to create diamonds (i.e. banging video content).\nIn other words, the Coal Mining technique is when you are actively mining for video ideas from other sources.\nDepending on your niche and the content you’re producing, there’s likely to be a number of different hot spots you can keep going back to from across the internet to generate ideas. Whenever you find one of these hot spots (like a YouTube channel, podcast, or website), and you can sense that there’s a lot of content that ties in nicely with the stuff you want to make, you just make a note of the link. These links then go into our Coal Mine for future reference.\n\nOriginal Source vs Derivative\nWhen you’re starting out with the Coal Mining technique it’s totally fine to use a blog post and apply your own lens to it when creating a YouTube video. But over time, as you become more of an authority in your field, you want to go to the original sources and have your own interpretation of it. Rather than using already distilled content that’s a third or fourth derivative of the original research paper.\nWe can’t all get rich selling each other’s shoes\nThis phrase captures the idea nicely.\nAt the start, you certainly can get rich doing this. For example, I’m learning to draw but not trying to make any original art. I’m just copying references of superheroes as best I can so I can learn the ropes. The same is fine when you’re learning to make YouTube videos.\nBut over time you want to go back to the original sources and make yourself an authority in a space, rather than distilling the wisdom of others. This is the only way for you to think of unique video ideas and reach your full potential, as you’ll no longer be ‘selling other people’s shoes’.\n Building Systems\nThe ABC method of idea generation is only as good as the system behind it. If you don’t have a system to properly store/capture your ideas you’re just going to forget them all. This clearly isn’t very helpful.\nIdeally you want to write all your ideas down as quickly as possible. The easiest way of doing this is probably to just make a note of everything in your phone’s default notes app, but this is still pretty slow.\nMy solution was something I call the ‘magic insight logging framework’. I talk about this and my other systems for capturing ideas in a lot more depth on my course, the Part-Time YouTuber Academy. But the essential point is that if you use an app like Readwise, you can quickly share all the things that resonate with you into the app from Kindle, Instapaper, podcasts, and Twitter. These insights can then be directly shared into something like Notion (my favourite app), which makes it super easy to build a database of video ideas.\n\nAs I already mentioned, If you want to hear more about the systems and workflow I use for YouTube (including my Idea Generation Machine) this is something I spend a lot of time discussing during the PTYA – so make sure you sign up if this interests you.\n Conclusion\nThe objective as a YouTuber is to never run out of ideas. If you’re lacking ideas, you’re not going to consistently create content and each video will feel like a heavy lift. This will inevitably end in you giving up.\nSo having different methods to effortlessly generate and capture ideas – like the ABC method – is key to finding success and enjoying your YouTube journey."

    "article_body": "This post discusses how I use Alfred to increase my efficiency/productivity on my MacBook. If you spend some time in front of a computer (even if it’s sadly not a mac), you might find the principle vaguely interesting.\nThe Problem\nTime is our most valuable non-renewable resource.\nI spend a huge amount of time in front of a computer/laptop. I’d like to think that most of that time is reasonably productive, i.e.: I’m getting stuff done (as opposed to simply browsing Facebook/Reddit/Youtube etc).\nI feel it’s really important, therefore, for me to attempt to maximise the efficiency of the process. I don’t mean in the sense of ensure that I don’t waste time on Facebook, but more the sense of I know what small action I want to accomplish at this moment, and I’d like for my computer to obey me as fast as possible.\nThis may sound a tad abstract, so let’s use a concrete example. Let’s say we want to open a file. The ‘ordinary’ (read: normal) person’s way of opening the file on a Mac would be to use Finder to locate the file and double-click it. However, if we look a bit closer at this seemingly simple process, it takes quite a few steps (using my third year research project PDF as an example)\n\nMove the mouse to the bottom of the screen to the Mac dock\nClick on Finder\nClick on Google Drive in the sidebar (because everything important’s backed up in the cloud, obviously)\nClick on ‘Third Year’\nClick on ‘Project’\nClick on ‘PDFs’\nDouble-click on ‘Ali Abdaal Part II Project.pdf’\n\nThis whole process of opening the file takes 10-15 seconds. In other words, there’s a 10-15 second lag between us thinking I want to open this file, and the file being open on the computer in front of us. That may not sound like a big deal, but when we consider the ridiculous amount of time it’s possible to spend on a computer, and the huge number of ‘small actions’ we take during this time, the seconds add up to minutes, hours, days, and ultimately, we’ve wasted years of our lives doing mundane intermediate tasks to achieve our ultimate goal (in this example, simply opening a particular file).\nHow would we optimise the process? Well, as I mentioned at earlier, the ultimate goal is to minimise the time between thinking of a command, and the computer executing that command.\nThe ultimate goal is to minimise the time delay between the user thinking of a command, and the computer executing that command\nThus, having introduced the objective of this post (in a somewhat wordy fashion), I’ll now go over some of the tools and techniques I personally use to optimise my time in front of the computer. Of course, these may not be the absolute best methods out there, but they’re the ones I’ve found quite useful, and I’m always open to more.\nThe Solution – Alfred\nAlfred is a wonderful Mac app, and is the single, most useful tool in my ‘productivity arsenal’. Essentially, it’s the Mac Spotlight on steroids – you bring it up with a quick keyboard shortcut (I use CMD + Spacebar) and then type whatever you want to launch.\nHere’s what their website says:\nAlfred is an award-winning app for Mac OS X which boosts your efficiency with hotkeys and keywords. Search your Mac and the web effortlessly, and control your Mac using customised actions with the Powerpack.\n\nUse Case 1 – Opening Files\nThe problem I mentioned initially was opening a file deep within an organised tree of folders. With Alfred, the process of opening it couldn’t be simpler – I simply bring up Alfred and type a few characters of the filename (preceded by a space, as that’s the Alfred shortcut for searching for files). And bam – within around 2-3 seconds (depending on typing speed), we’ve got the file we wanted open. Here’s a GIF explaining the process.\n\nUse Case 2 – Opening Apps\nFor opening files, we typed in a space before the filename. To open apps, we just type the name of app (or the first few characters of the name), and we’re sorted. This feature is so useful that I’ve set the Mac dock as hidden – what’s the point of moving the mouse to click on the Spotify icon when you can just launch Alfred (with CMD + Spacebar), type S and hit , a process that takes less than a second compared to the multiple seconds moving the mouse would take.\n\nUse Case 3 – Searching Google\nWhile the above two things can be done in Spotlight, the Google search feature of Alfred is incredibly useful and (as far as I know) can’t be done in Spotlight. To search Google for anything, simply open up Alfred and type whatever you want. Alfred recognises that what you’re typing isn’t an app and therefore it searches Google for the term.\n\nUse Case 4 – Searching Amazon\nYou know that feeling when you remember you’re running out of toothpaste, and need to order some via Amazon. The normal way of doing this would be to open up Chrome, put in the Amazon URL (which would, in fairness, be autocompleted), click on the search box and then type in ‘toothpaste’. The Alfred way of doing it is to launch Alfred, type ‘AMA Toothpaste’, hit the key and be happy with the 5 seconds of your life you’ve saved.\nAlfred Workflows\nOne of the nice things about Alfred is that you can create custom ‘workflows’ to automate tedious tasks. Even better, you can download existing workflows online which link to apps you use in other parts of your life.\nFantastical + Alfred\nOne of my favourite Alfred workflows combines Alfred with Fantastical (a really nice mac and iOS calendar app). I use this workflow to add events to my calendar using natural language.\nFor example, let’s say I get an email saying that there’s a lecture tomorrow from 9-10am at the Clifford Abbott Lecture Theatre. To add this to my Google calendar (via Fantastical), I launch Alfred and type ‘cal tomorrow 9am lecture at CALT’, hit and everything gets added to the calendar in the right boxes.\n\nAlternatively, if I get a WhatsApp message saying that Katherine’s birthday party is next Friday from 7-10pm at Nando’s, I’d immediately launch Alfred, and type ‘cal next friday 7-10pm kat birthday party at nandos’, which would insert everything I need to know into my calendar. Pretty cool right?\n\nOther Custom Workflows\nHere’s a list of the workflows I’ve got active these days, most of which save just a small amount of time, but those small amounts add up to make me (hopefully) a lot more efficient when using my computer.\n\nFor example, let’s say I see an email in Front from someone asking for an Interview Crash Course bursary. Previously, I’d have to open up the admin panel of the interview crash course website, find WooCommerce in the sidebar, click on Coupons and then click on Add New (which would take around 15 seconds of active work). Now, to get to the same page, I simply launch Alfred and type ‘int cou’ – Alfred autofills the rest, and takes me straight to the page where I can create the coupon code.\nOr for those times when I’m buying some random piece of software online, and it’s asking for the 6med VAT number to apply the VAT 20% discount. Back in the day, I’d have to open one of our websites, copy the number from the footer and paste it into the box. Now, I just use the Alfred workflow – by launching Alfred and typing ‘6med VA’ and hitting , the VAT number is automatically inserted into the appropriate input box. An even better way of doing this would be to create a snippet that replaces the phrase ‘6medVAT’ with our VAT number, for example.\nClosing Remarks\nSo yeah, that’s how I use Alfred to improve my efficiency when using my Mac. The aim (as with most productivity tools) is to minimise the time between thinking of an action and getting the computer to perform the action.\nIf you haven’t tried using Alfred, I’d suggest downloading it (it’s free!) and giving it a go. Heck, even the Mac built-in spotlight works quite well these days, and in fact, quite a few people prefer it to Alfred. Either way, using the keyboard to navigate a computer tends to be much quicker than using the mouse/trackpad, so you’ll save a lot of time in the long run"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nI recently took a 20-hour trip to Paris with some of my team to work on my book. I’ve been working with BookTuber Jack Edwards for some time on shaping the book and Jack happens to be one of these cool people who lives in Paris and takes sunset runs near the Eiffel Tower.\nWe both thought it would be be nice to meet up and work in a Parisian cafe. So we sipped on coffee and munched on proper baguettes and cheese, which – to be honest – was only slightly better than my trusty old Pret-A-Manger sandwiches. The good news is that the trip turned out to be a surprisingly productive. There is definitely something magical about working in person rather than over zoom.\n\n\n\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we spent some time thinking about how to make our productivity last for longer. Here’s the thing – we usually think about productivity in terms of getting started, but equally important is making it sustainable so that we can complete what we started without feeling exhausted.\nSo, we started asking ourselves some of the following questions. After we’ve managed to get started, what are some problems we usually face with completing what we’ve started? How do we continue doing what we want to do with our initial excitement, especially when the honeymoon period is over? How much of our productivity problems are down to struggling to get started versus struggling to keep going? (And does this difference even matter?)\n The most interesting thing we learned\nWe learned a lot about burnout. It turns out that the World Health Organization (WHO) now recognizes burnout as an official mental health concern. According to the WHO, burnout is caused by chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed and there are 3 related symptoms:\nBurnout is an official\n\nFeeling a lack of energy or exhaustion\nFeeling mentally disengaged from/negative towards your job\nBeing not very effective at what you’re doing\n\nI didn’t realize that burnout is mainly considered a work-related, rather than a personal, problem. And it seems like this is a serious problem. This 2015 survey found that 77% of US professional have experienced employee burnout at their current job and that work-related stress affects the quality of their work, their personal relationships, and how they feel towards their work.\nQuestion of the week\nAll of this has made us think about our awareness of, attitudes towards, and experiences of burnout. I’d love to hear from you about this. If you’re up for answering some quick questions and/or sharing a story that might feature in the book, please check out our survey here.\nSome questions that we’ll ask are:\nDo you think burnout is a serious problem? Do you/have you experienced burnout? If so, what do you think are the main reasons for it?\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on autonomy where we asked you for tips on how to feel more autonomous at work. We really enjoyed reading through your responses! Shoutout to these great answers:\nLauren shared how busy life can get as a student athlete with ambitious academic goals – thank you for speaking about your experiences so openly.\nI run cross country and track and field at a division one university, and am currently pursuing a chemistry degree… Most of my days are spent rushing between track sessions, classes, labs, weightlifting, and study sessions with little more than 15 min between each…. I often find myself feeling as if my time isn’t my own and I’m a bit of a slave to time commitments/simply trying to balance it all…. even though I loved everything I was doing, I was constantly exhausted and found myself desperate for a break….Ultimately, what helped me get out of it was completely reframing the way I looked at my commitments. Behind all the chaos, I truly am living a dream. I love running, and I’m studying a subject I find completely captivating.\nGuillermo shared a story about taking initiative when some dodgy behavior was going on in his company- this is really inspiring!\nThe Sales Director decided to make false customer appointments to satiate the senior management. I didn’t approve of it, but could not speak up right away… Deciding to change without taking head on, I decided to get in touch with our Head of Sales and proposed him another solution… I quickly assumed the responsibility to lead sales of the newly developed product, a responsibility beyond my typical role….In this way, I turned around an ethically challenging issue and creatively solved the problem.\nAnd Selma shared two reminders she uses to shift her mindset\nDays when I’m forced to do something I don’t have control over, I immediately make myself conscious of my attitude. I remind myself of two things: 1. A quote I love by Marcus Aurelius: You have power over your mind — not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. 2. I don’t have to do this thing; I get to do it.\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    ],
    "article_body": "If we want to succeed as a YouTuber, people often say that you should niche down to blow up. In other words, they say that having a narrow content niche is the single most worthwhile thing when it comes to building our YouTube audience.\nTo an extent, these people are right. For example, let’s say you were starting a business, it’s a lot harder to say I want to sell everything than it is to say I want to sell this specific thing that solves this specific customer problem.\nAnd it’s the same with YouTube. Making videos for people within a well-defined niche helps you to get discovered by the right people and probably gives you the best chance of growing your channel.\nBut, having said that, if we’re just getting started it’s totally okay for our niche to emerge over time and to enjoy the creative freedom of having a ‘nicheless’ channel. You shouldn’t let not having a niche be the thing that stops you from starting YouTube. It’s better to just get started than sit around for weeks waiting to discover your perfect niche.\nBroadly, then, there are two main ways we can think about finding our niche: the architect and the archaeologist.\nArchitect vs Archeologist\nAn architect is someone that will carefully plan everything in advance of laying the first brick. They know exactly what they’re going to create before they create it. In our case, an architect is someone who wants to plan their channel and discover their perfect niche before they even think about filming their first video. There’s a lot of upfront work that keeps them from starting their YouTube journey.\nAn archeologist is someone who doesn’t necessarily know what they’re going to find, but they begin digging and will eventually stumble across something really interesting. This then inspires them to dig some more, excited by what they’ve found. In our case, the architect is someone who begins filming without knowing in the exact direction they want to take their channel. But, as they film and publish more content, they gradually discover what they enjoy and their niche emerges over time.\nGiven that most readers are likely to be beginners on YouTube, my advice is to take the approach of the archaeologist. It’s not something that’s going to make or break your channel in the early days.\nBut, even as an archaeologist, it’s still worth thinking about where we want to metaphorically start digging. And we do this by using the ‘PD Matrix’.\nWhy Find a Niche?\nBy creating video content within a well-defined niche, people are more likely to come across our content and think woah this is exactly what I’m looking for. As such, they’re going to engage with our videos, rally behind our message, and become loyal subscribers with shared interests.\nIt’s easy to tell ourselves that nobody will bother watching our content if we’re too niche. But the truth is that all niches have the opportunity to ‘blow up’. Just check out the Hydraulic Press Channel if you don’t believe me – who’d have thought that crushing stuff would be so entertaining?\nIn the last couple of years, I’ve noticed that people are increasingly turning to YouTube for these niche entertainment and learning opportunities, so our audience is definitely out there. All we’ve got to do then is find our niche and stick with it.\nFinding Our Niche: The PD Matrix\nThe Passion-Demand Matrix (or PD Matrix for short) is a method of quickly and accurately discovering our YouTube niche. The idea is that if we can find a topic that interests us (i.e. a passion) and has a clearly identifiable target audience (i.e. a demand), we’ll come across a topic where we can offer an insane amount of value. This unique combination of interest, audience, and value is our niche.\n\nThe PD Matrix works as follows:\n\nBox 1 (Passion x Demand) topics are those that we personally love and are also popular with other people too. So our ideal niche is found in box 1. And it’s where we can offer the most value.\nBox 2 (No Passion x Demand) topics also have a wide audience, but we don’t personally find them interesting. As a result, they make us bored and are best avoided.\nBox 3 (Passion x No Demand) topics, on the other hand, are ones we love but nobody else cares about. This means nobody is going to watch our content or subscribe to our channel. So this wouldn’t be a great place to find our niche either.\nBox 4 (No Passion x No Demand) topics are the ones we don’t enjoy and neither does anyone else. So focusing our attention on these topics would be a complete waste of time and the worst possible place to find our niche.\n\nClearly then, finding the perfect niche for our YouTube channel means finding a topic that sits squarely in box 1 of the PD Matrix – a topic that we’re passionate about and that other people are demanding to watch too.\nLet’s take a look at each of these two requirements now.\n Step 1: Passion\nThe first step to finding our niche is to think about our passions. After all, we’re going to have to come up with new content on a regular basis, so if we don’t enjoy what we’re doing we’ll quickly get bored of making our videos. Plus, it’s difficult to talk enthusiastically and engage the viewer when we’re chatting about something we’ve got no interest in.\nBasically, this step involves looking inwards and asking ourselves some questions about our strengths, the things we want to do on YouTube, and the unique qualities we offer to people. The objective is to literally brain dump whatever the hell we think about in response to these questions, and we can always refine our answers later as we build a clearer picture of our passions.\nWhat do I enjoy?\nTo begin with, we need to write a list of all the topics we genuinely enjoy. When answering this question it’s pretty easy to end up writing a bunch of stuff we’re only slightly interested in. Don’t fall into that trap. Try to write a list of topics that we’re actually passionate about.\nMy threshold for putting something on the list is to ask myself whether or not I can hold a lengthy conversation about it. If that’s not possible, I won’t write it down. I also like to think about the topics I’m already familiar with (such as my jobs and my hobbies), as that’s often a good place to start when looking for the things we enjoy.\nThere’s no need for us to be a specialist in our chosen topic for it to be an acceptable YouTube niche. As Austin Kleon says in ‘Show Your Work‘, we don’t have to be an expert to begin sharing our stuff. The important thing is that we find something we enjoy.\nWhat do I want from YouTube?\nThis question encourages us to visualise our future channel. We need to think about what our YouTube channel is going to look like in 2-3 years and all the things that excite us about the process of getting there. If we’re not passionate about the topics we’re going to talk about in the future then our niche obviously needs to be different.\nFor example, I want my channel to consist of evergreen content that compounds over time and helps people to live happier, healthier, and more productive lives. I’m particularly excited by the prospect of building a reputation for sharing useful content and achieving my dream of financial freedom.\nIf we’re happy about our channel’s future, we can be somewhat confident that our niche is a good one. And we’ll keep heading in the right direction for many years to come.\n\nWhat’s my unfair advantage?\nThis final question gets us to think about how our passions give us an unfair advantage. Put another way, we need to find what feels like play to us but looks like work to other people.\nWhat feels like play to me but looks like work to other people?\nFor example, when I started with YouTube, I used the fact I studied medicine at Cambridge as my unfair advantage. This was something I enjoyed, something that couldn’t easily be copied, and something I could create content about. In other words, I built a ‘personal monopoly’ that helped me to get some early subscriber growth.\nMy golden advice is to use our unfair advantage to serve the smallest possible niche we can find. As an example, I started on YouTube by using my unfair advantage to create videos on med school admission tests. That way, people had a clear reason to subscribe and it made it 10x easier to expand my niche later to incorporate all my other interests (such as productivity, studying, and entrepreneurship).\n\n Step 2: Demand\nThe second step to finding our perfect niche is to think about our potential audience and the sort of content they’re searching for. If we’re thinking about making videos about how to cook productively, but nobody is searching for this sort of content, then this niche probably isn’t going to work.\nHaving said that, the flip side can be just as unhelpful when it comes to succeeding on YouTube. If there’s a lot of people searching for a certain topic the chances are YouTube will be saturated with similar videos already. If that’s the case, it’s going to be very hard to get our content noticed.\nThis isn’t to say we can’t make videos within a saturated niche, but we would have to find a unique way to approach things. In other words, we’d have to do something different or better than everyone else if we want to succeed.\nBut hey, the important thing is we find a topic that we’re passionate about and that other people are watching. And, if that’s the case, we need to have a clear picture of who those people are by creating a ‘target persona’.\nSpecific Target Avatar\nFinding the right niche isn’t just about what content we create but also about who we’re trying to appeal to. This helps us to tailor our message, keep our videos focused, and create a community of like-minded subscribers.\nTo create a specific target avatar we need to choose one of the topics we’re passionate about (from step 1) and build a detailed picture of our ideal viewer. The goal is to go into as much detail as possible, including information about their background, worries, fears, struggles, beliefs, and frustrations.\nIt’s totally worth giving this task a go but it can be a bit tricky. So to help you out, try answering the following questions:\n\nWho are they?\nWhat do they want?\nWhy can’t they get what they want?\nWhat are the stakes if they don’t get what they want?\nWhat transformation would they experience if they finally got what they want?\nWhat keeps them up at night?\nWhat are they afraid of?\nWhat are they angry about? Who are they angry at?\nWhat are their top 3 daily frustrations?\nWhat do they believe about the world?\n\nOver the past few years I’ve also been developing the target avatar for my channel and I’ve found that picturing a younger version of myself, with a few more inconsistencies, is a good place to start if we’re still not sure about how our ideal viewer looks and behaves. In fact, that’s kinda the approach I’ve been taking and I affectionately named this target persona ‘Medic Mo’. Here’s a short snippet of what I wrote:\nMo (short for Mohammed) is a 20 year-old medical student at Imperial College London. He lives in London during term time, but his family live in Manchester – he goes back there for the holidays. He’s sort-of enjoying his degree – the work is a bit tedious but it’s interesting at times. He’s really enjoying the university experience – he loves chilling with his friends and chatting or playing board games until 3am several times a week. He sometimes misses the morning lectures, but always manages to catch up. He feels that going to lectures is probably a bit pointless because they’re all online anyway, and he can be more efficient if he just reads stuff in a textbook or watches a YouTube video rather than listening to the boring lecturer drone on and on.\n Step 3: Value\nNow we’ve defined our passion and found a specific audience for that content (a ‘box 1’ topic from the PD Matrix), we’re very close to having our YouTube niche. The last thing we need to do is clarify what value we’re offering to our viewers through this content. As mentioned before, it’s the combination of our passion, our audience, and our value that gives us our niche.\nOur value proposition is about what we do and why we do it. Put simply, our audience wants to see whether or not there’s a value or benefit in watching our content. Ultimately, there’s no point finding our ‘box 1’ topic if it isn’t also solving a problem or connecting with people enough to get them to like, subscribe, or share our videos.\nPrice is what you pay. Value is what you get. – Warren Buffett\nThere are loads of great ways to find our value proposition, but it largely comes down to answering these three questions:\n\nWhat’s the value that I want my viewers to get from my channel?\nWhy should they care about my videos?\nWhat about my channel is going to keep them coming back?\n\nFor example, my value proposition is in helping people to learn the tools and strategies to live more productively. In particular, I think people care about my content because I break down helpful tips in an intellectual, clear, and actionable manner. Plus I create pretty useful summaries of different books, podcasts, and relevant academic studies that can be immediately used to improve our lives.\nOn this channel we explore some of the strategies and tools that help us live healthier, happier, more productive lives.\nFinding our value proposition is really just about establishing creator-audience fit. This is where the content we enjoy making very closely aligns with what our audience enjoy and benefit from consuming too. So while the PD Matrix helps us to find the topic we enjoy and our potential audience for that topic, the value proposition is the message that binds those two aspects together.\nIt’s this mix of individual passion, audience demand, and inherent value that gives us our perfect niche.\nPassion + Demand (+ Value) = Our Niche\nConclusion\nOther than having a consistent posting schedule, one of the key factors to YouTube success is spending some time thinking about our perfect niche. In essence, this boils down to finding a topic that we enjoy, our audience demand, and offering something that delivers an insane amount of value to the viewer.\nIf we’ve found the right niche we’ll know about it for sure: the whole YouTube journey becomes a lot more enjoyable, subscriber growth becomes effortless, and we’ll find numerous ways to effectively monetise our channel.\nBut as a beginner, don’t worry too much about this sort of stuff. It’s good to keep your niche in mind, but it’s not going to be the thing that helps you learn and build your audience in the first few months. Just get filming and let your niche define itself over time – it’s a much better use of your time.\nIf you’re interested in finding more about how I grew my channel and how to find the right niche, make sure you check out my live course, the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, where I talk about all of this in a lot more depth.

    "article_body": "I’ve been thinking about some personal stories that I want to include in my book as a way of sharing what I’ve learned about work, productivity, and happiness. Lately, most of the stories I’ve been thinking of are from my days as a junior doctor pulling long nights on a hospital ward. And I got a bit worried about how similar all those stories were to one another. Am I too boring? Do I have enough interesting stories and original ideas to write a whole book?\nThen I stumbled on this quote by the poet Rainer Maria Rilke in his Letters to a Young Poet\nIf your everyday life seems to lack material, do not blame it; blame yourself, tell yourself that you are not poet enough to summon up its riches, for there is no lack for him who creates and no poor, trivial place.\nI often feel that my days look pretty similar day-to-day. But this quote really helped remind me that even when we’re going through repetitive or monotonous phases in our lives (or when I feel like I’ve run dry of stories), it’s more about the perspective through which I tell the story rather than the plot of the story.\nThis is something Matthew Dicks talks about in his incredible book Storyworthy (which was my favourite non-fiction book that I read in 2020) – no one wants to hear your travel or drinking stories. Instead, they want to hear about stories in your day-to-day life that resulted in a personal transformation.\n What we worked on this week\nAnyway, speaking of being worried about not being good enough, this week we looked at work-related anxiety and stress. Recent statistics show that workplace stress is a serious problem with over 8 out of 10 Americans reporting having experienced work-related stress.\nThere are lots of reasons why people experience workplace stress – bad bosses, societal pressures to perform well, attaching your identity too much to work etc. Regardless of the main source of workplace stress, one thing seems to be common across all these causes – it can lower our productivity and lead to a vicious negative cycle – we’re stressed out because we’re worried that we’re not performing well, and this stress makes it harder for us to perform well, so this negative cycle continues…\n The most interesting thing we learned\nBut is stress always a bad thing? Apparently not. There’s this relationship between stress and performance called the Yerkes-Dodson curve. It was discovered by two Harvard psychologists Robert Yerkes and John Dillingham Dodson back in the 1900s.\nThe two psychologists found that when we’re focusing on general anxiety (i.e. non-disordered anxiety – an important caveat), there’s a U-shaped relationship between performance and stress/anxiety. Too much is bad for performance. But too little is also bad because we feel no urge or motivation to get things done. Ever since Yerkes and Dodson discovered this relationship, other researchers have also demonstrated it through experiments in both animals and humans.\n\n\n\nThe Yerkes-Dodson curve reminds me of psychologist Kelly McGonigal’s Ted Talk. In that talk, Kelly talks about how to turn stress into an advantage. There are, of course, people who suffer from serious anxiety and need medical help for it. But what’s interesting about these studies is that they seem to suggest that if our anxiety is of the general (not disordered) kind then perhaps there are ways to learn to use our anxiety as a source of energy to motivate us to get things done.\nQuestion of the week\nSo, in the survey for this week, I’d love to get your thoughts on your experiences of anxiety and any tips on how you deal with it. If you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please check out our survey here.\nWe’re going to ask you questions like…\n\nYour experiences of work-related anxiety\nWhat it feels like when you experience work-related anxiety\nWhether you think we can use anxiety to our disadvantage\nAny tips and tricks that you have to deal with work-related anxiety\n\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on burnout. It was pretty cool to see how your responses lined up with a lot of the existing theories that we’ve read about in books and journal articles. Here are some highlights:.\n\nOver 8 in 10 of you agree or strongly agree that burnout is a serious problem\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of you very kindly provided some insightful reasons for experiencing burnout. These 4 reasons came up repeatedly\nBoredom and dissatisfaction at work\nPerfectionism and having a desire to please people constantly\nLoving your job too much and giving too much, and neglecting your personal needs as a result\nBad managements/bosses who put too much pressure on you and your work\n\nIf you can think of anything else on that front, please do let us know through the survey \nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "A chap called Jack Bogle died last week, at the age of 89. You may not have heard of him. He founded a company called Vanguard and introduced the world to ‘index funds’.\nAn index fund is the best way to invest in the stock market. Essentially, when you put, let’s say £1,000 into an index fund, you’re actually buying shares in lots of different companies. The S&amp;P500 is one example of an index fund. It covers the 500 biggest companies in the USA (Apple, Facebook, Amazon etc). So if you were to put £1,000 in the S&amp;P500, you’d own a little bit of each of these 500 huge companies.\nThat’s great news. It means you never have to worry about what company to buy stocks in, and your money isn’t dependent on the profitability of any one company. Instead, your money is spread out between these 500 companies and overall, because the stock market always goes up, you never lose money over the long term.\nThose two ideas are worth repeating. (1) The stock market always goes up. (2) You will not lose money over the long term.\nThis might seem very counter-intuitive if you’re not familiar with how stocks work. Most people who hear the phrase ‘stock market’ immediately think of stuff like the 2008 crash, and probably know some random uncle who ‘lost a lot of money in the stock market’.\nBut the stock market is a great way to make free money, and investing in index funds is the best way to make this free money over the long term without much risk.\nExplaining this in detail is probably beyond the scope of this post, but if you’re at all interested in making free money, definitely read this article: Mr Money Moustache – How to make money in the stock market. It explains the basics of how stocks work, why the market always goes up, and how you can get started with investing in it.\nMr Money Moustache is one of my favourite blogs of all time, and when I discovered stock market investing a few years ago, I binged every post on the website and learned a huge amount. In fact, since I started investing in stock market index funds in 2015, I’ve made over £10,000 of ‘free money’ – ie: my money has been sitting in the S&amp;P500 generating more money without me having to do any work. That’s pretty magical.\nThe idea of ‘investing’ and the phrase ‘stock market’ often cause people to quake in their boots. But if we look beyond the media hype about stock market crashes and people jumping out of windows on Wall Street, we find that the maths is pretty simple, and by following some basic rules anyone can make ‘free money’ in the stock market – even you \n\nEnjoyed this post?

    "article_body": "In this article, I’m going to talk about nine different ways to make passive income. I’ll apply my Side Hustle Assessment Matrix to each method, evaluating how difficult they are in three aspects:\n\nHow hard is it to get started?\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month?\nHow hard is it to maintain an income?\n\nEach method will be given a rating out of five in these categories, one meaning very easy and five being very difficult.\nThese days, these nine different sources generate around $27,000 per week for me and my business, with varying degrees of passiveness. It’s taken me over nine years to build up to this figure.\nOne can’t expect to be making an extravagant amount in the earlier days of their foray into passive income generation. But this article contains advice that I wish was available to me when I started my financial independence journey many, many years ago.\nWhat is passive income?\nThere’s really no such thing as passive income. There’s no way to make money without doing anything at all. When I say passive income, I mean money that’s not directly tied to our time.\nLet’s say you were to write a book. You publish it and that book’s now on bookshelves. You’ve done the work once to write the book and find a publisher.\nNow every time someone buys a copy of your book, you make money from royalties. That’s passive income. You could literally be making money while you sleep because you’ve created a product that’s out in the world generating income for you.\nThe other thing with passive income is it always takes a very long time to get going. So if you see advertisements about how you can get rich quick, or if people on social media tell you to message them if you want to make a quick buck, that’s all a scam. It’s not going to work.\nThere’s no way to get rich quick. So if you’re looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, I’ve bad news for you: they don’t exist.\nUltimately money’s just a medium for exchanging value. The only way to make money is to provide value. And the only way to make passive money is to provide value in a way that’s not directly tied to your time. So please don’t join a get-rich-quick scheme.\nOver the years, I’ve gotten messages from loads of people who signed up for things like cryptocurrency schemes and gambling schemes in the hopes of making a quick buck. They always end up losing money.\nThe only way to make money is by providing value. So let’s talk about the nine different ways that you could potentially provide value that generates passive income.\n1) Invest in stocks and shares\nWhen we buy stocks from a company, we’re giving them our money. This is a way of providing value. So It makes sense that we’d get some kind of return for that investment. We’re starting with this because investing in stocks is the easiest way to make any kind of passive income.\nLet’s say you’ve money in a savings account and it’s earning 0.01% interest. It’s not really doing very much for you. If you put those same savings into stocks, you could potentially be earning passive income from money that would otherwise just be sitting there.\nJust a disclaimer: I’m not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. These are tips I can offer you based on my personal experience with investing.\nWhen you’re getting started with stock market investment, conventional wisdom would advise you to invest in an index fund. Most of my money that’s in the stock market is invested in such funds. An index fund’s something like the S&amp;P 500.\nLet’s say you invest $1000 in the S&amp;P 500. That money’s basically distributed amongst the top 500 companies in the United States (US), weighted by how big they are.\nFor example, 2% of your money might be invested in each of the tech giants i.e. Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. You might not even have heard of the 500th company on the list. Basically you end up investing a little bit in each of the US stock market’s biggest companies.\nHow hard is it to start investing in stocks and shares?\n\nAll you really need to do is sign up with a stockbroker. If you’re in the US you can use Weebl. Residents of the United Kingdom (UK) can use Freetrade or Vanguard.\nWhatever country you’re in, you’d just have to Google some version of the phrase: best stock broker platform + country name. This’ll lead you to a service that works for you. After that, it’s very easy to just invest in an index fund.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from the stock market?\n\nThis factor can actually be highly variable because it depends on the overall performance of the stock market.\nFor example, from 2020 to 2021 the S&amp;P 500 had actually increased by about 50%. That was a big increase, especially considering how Covid impacted markets. So if you’d invested $2400 in the S&amp;P 500 in April 2020, you’d have made $100 a month over the next year.\nObviously this isn’t the best way to assess this factor.The stock market goes up and down. Its performance varies depending on the time period that we’re considering.\nBut if we average out the last three decades, the S&amp;P 500 has had a roughly 10% return. This means every year, on average over the last 30 years, it went up by about 10%. This isn’t inflation adjusted.\nLet’s do some quick, back-of-the-envelope calculations: you want to make $100 a month, which is $1200 a year. Going by a very average figure, your annual returns will be 10%. This means your initial investment will need to be $12,000.\nAs I talked about in How to Invest for Beginners, over time our initial investment also compounds. So if you put $7500 in the S&amp;P 500 and leave it there, after five years you’d be making roughly $100 a month — if we go by the very average figure of 10% returns annually.\nSimilarly, if you invested $5000 in the S&amp;P 500, then 10 years later you’d be making $100 a month in purely passive income. Again, assuming the 10% average.\nSo overall, how hard is it really to make $100 a month in passive income from stocks and shares? Well, it kind of just depends on how hard it is for you to collect $5000, $7500, or $12,000 in savings and put them into a stock market index fund.\nCrucially, this is money that you shouldn’t need to touch in the next five to ten years, at the very least. How easy it’s for you to make that sort of money obviously varies massively. It depends on which country you’re in, what your circumstances are, and what work you do.\nIf you’re in the UK or the US, where the median salary is around $50,000 then ,again depending on your circumstances, it’s not that hard to accumulate $10,000 in savings. Obviously if you’re supporting a family of 15 people on $50,000 a month, then it’s a very different situation to that of a single person’s.\nIn a country like India, where the average salary is $3600 a year, it’s very difficult to save $10000 and would take much longer. In that case, the difficulty of making $100 from the stock market would obviously be more than my rating.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from the stock market?\n\nOnce you’ve saved up enough money and invested it, you can just leave it there and forget about it. There are other sources of passive income that require higher degrees of maintenance over time. But stocks and shares are a very easy way to make passive income.\nHow much do I make from the stock market?\nI’ve been investing in stocks and shares since 2015 and my portfolio’s currently worth around $350,000. The vast majority of that’s in the S&amp;P 500 index fund.\nI can’t be bothered to work out the actual inflation adjusted returns. But if we assume a very rough average of 10% a year, then that comes to about $650 per week in purely passive income.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the stock market and how exactly it works, you can also check out my video How to Invest for Beginners.\n2) Start a YouTube Channel\nThis is a path that I pretty much specialise in, if I do say so myself. I’ve got my own YouTube channel and I actually teach a course called the Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\nThe course’s all about how to start a YouTube channel, even if you’ve no prior experience in making video content. Enrolments for our next cohort are actually live, so check out my website if you’re interested.\nHow hard is it to start a YouTube channel?\n\nIt’s actually very easy to start a YouTube channel. You just go on youtube.com and create a channel. You can pretty much just film videos on your phone and upload them.\nOf course, it’s actually a lot harder to make good videos. And making good videos is how you grow on YouTube. But getting started is pretty straightforward.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from YouTube?\n\nThe real question is: how hard is it to actually make money from YouTube? Firstly, to be eligible for monetization on YouTube, you need 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. It took me six months and 52 videos to get my first 1000 subscribers.\nIf we look at the averages, it takes about 90 videos to reach 1000 subscribers. That’s quite hard.\nIt’s not possible to start a YouTube channel and begin making money that very day. It took me six months to get there. You’ve to be able to put in the effort and do this for a very long period of time. I’d say you’d need to upload at least one video each week for at least two years before you can expect any returns.\nLet’s say you’ve hit your 1000 subscribers and 4000 hours of watch time. How hard is it to then make $100 a month? On average, you’d get about $2 per 1000 views. This varies massively and, for now, we’ll go with this average of $2.\nIf you want to make $100 a month, you’d then need 50,000 views on your channel every month. Let’s say you make one video per week and you’re not getting any significant traffic on your older videos. That means every video you make needs to get about 12,500 views.\nVery roughly, the average YouTube channel can expect about 20% of their subscribers to equal the average view count for each video. So to get 12,500 views on each video, you’d need about 60,000 total subscribers on your channel.\nIn reality, you’d probably be able to start making $100 per month before reaching 60,000 subscribers. I think I was making $100 every month when I had about 10,000 subscribers. It was fairly early on.\nHaving said that, it’s actually very hard to make compelling YouTube videos. It’s very easy to get started, but it’s hard to do it well.\nIt’s totally worth it, it’s a great skill set, and it’s really fun. You get to meet people across the world through the Internet. You learn how to talk to a camera, how to film and edit videos. So it’s really fun but it’s very hard to actually make money.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from YouTube?\n\nGetting those 1000 subscribers is a lot harder than keeping it growing. Once you’ve got 1000 subscribers and your channel begins to grow, it means you’ve landed on a formula that works. So maintaining it then becomes easier than starting from scratch.\nHow much do I make from my YouTube channel?\nI started making money from YouTube AdSense after my 70th video. These days the YouTube channel makes about $12000 every month in passive income from AdSense. This comes to about $3000 every week.\nAgain, this isn’t entirely passive because I keep uploading new videos. But actually the bulk of the money that we generate from ads is from older videos rather than videos that were uploaded this month.\nThere are other ways of monetizing YouTube, like brand deals and selling merch. But that doesn’t really count as passive income through YouTube, which is why I’m not including the money we generate through those revenue streams.\n3) Start a podcast\nStarting a podcast’s generally easier than starting a YouTube channel. But growing a podcast’s a lot harder than growing a YouTube channel. Podcasts themselves don’t really have an algorithm that’s helping them grow. In fact, a lot of podcasts grow by having a YouTube channel.\nHow hard is it to start a podcast?\n\nIt’s very easy to start a podcast. You could sign up on anchor.fm. Then you can literally just pass your phone around between you and your friends, record a conversation, and upload it as a podcast.\nYou can also use a website called Riverside that I’m actually an angel investor in. Riverside makes it very easy to record remote podcast interviews. So basically it’s not at all difficult to start a podcast.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from a podcast?\n\nAgain, this isn’t quite passive income because podcasters make money through brand deals. There isn’t an AdSense for podcasts. So you need a sponsorship or a brand deal to make money, generally speaking.\nApparently you can expect to make around $18 for a 30-second ad in a podcast. For a 60-second ad you can expect to make $25 per every 1000 listens.\nLet’s say you’re hitting the numbers to attract sponsors that are giving you $25 for every 1000 listens. To make $100, you’d need around 4000 downloads every month. If your podcast is weekly, that’d come to 1000 downloads for every episode.\nThis begs the question: how hard is it to get 1000 downloads per episode?\nWell, it’s a lot harder to get 1000 podcast downloads per month than it is to get 1000 YouTube views per video. Because, again, YouTube has so much distribution built into the platform, unlike podcasts.\nAlso, loads more people are watching YouTube videos than are listening to podcasts. If we look at the stats, the top 20% of podcasts in the world average more than 1000 downloads per episode.\nTo use a friend of mine as an example: my housemate Sheen Gurrib started her own podcast around two years ago. Within five months, her podcast was averaging about 400 to 500 downloads per episode.\nThis isn’t bad at all. Especially considering she had zero audience when she started. So she didn’t have the unfair advantage that I did when starting my own podcast, because I had already built an audience by then.\nSheen’s just launched season 2 of her podcast. She’s started posting videos about it on YouTube and that’ll really help the podcast grow. I’m pretty sure that in the next six months, she’ll be getting to a point where she can quite easily make $100 a month from her podcast.\nSo when it comes to making $100 a month, yes it’s hard to do so with a podcast. But because there’s no minimum threshold for reach and audience, it is possible to start making money sooner than you’d with a YouTube channel.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from a podcast?\n\nLike I said, this isn’t really passive income. You’d have to keep producing new podcast episodes because you’d be relying on brand deals. But, like with a YouTube channel, once you’ve stumbled on a formula that works it’s easier to keep going. As is the case with most things, really.\nHow much do I make from my podcasts?\nI currently produce two podcasts. My brother and I started a podcast called Not Overthinking about two and a half years ago. We make about $625 per week from brand deals and from our membership.\nAbout a year and a half ago I also started my own podcast Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal, where I interview leaders and experts from various fields.\n4) Become an affiliate marketer\nAffiliate marketing means that you’re selling other people’s products but you’re getting a percentage of the sales from those products.\nApparently 48% of affiliate marketers globally earn $20,000 a year. This comes to about $1600 a month, which is actually not bad at all. Overall, people are doing very well with affiliate marketing.\nHow hard is it to start in affiliate marketing?\n\nBasically you can just sign up to a program like Amazon Associates. This is Amazon’s own affiliate program and probably the largest in the world. They give you custom links that you can post on your website and social media.\nIf people buy a product on Amazon through your link, you’ll get a tiny percentage of the sales. So it’s pretty easy to get started with affiliate marketing.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from affiliate marketing?\n\nThis is actually kind of hard. Let’s say you’re trying to sell a product priced at $50 and getting 5% commission on it. That’d be pretty good.\nAssuming your average conversion rate – the people actually buying the product from everyone who visits the link – is 1%. That’s actually a pretty reasonable conversion rate. You’d then need 8000 visits to your affiliate link for you to make $100 every month.\nIt’s actually quite hard to get that many visits to your specific product page. Generally, doing well in affiliate marketing requires lots of upfront effort. You’ve to either build an audience or build enough domain authority to organically attract traffic.\nAlso, in reality Amazon’s affiliate commission ranges from 1% to 10% depending on the type of product.\nOther than Amazon, there’re a few other affiliate programs you can join. One of them is Skillshare, who’ve an interesting affiliate program. You can get $7 in affiliate commission if you get one person to sign up for a free trial.\nSo if you wanted to make $100 a month from Skillshare affiliates, you’d need 15 people every month to sign up for Skillshare through your link. How hard would that be? Well it’s not that hard if you’ve already built an audience. It’s even easier if you’ve your own classes on the platform.\nI personally have created 13 classes for Skillshare.\nSo if I want to make money through Skillshare affiliates, I can just tell my audience something along the lines of: Hey guys, check out my Productivity for Creators class, which also happens to be a Skillshare Staff Pick. In this class, I’ll teach you all about how to manage your time if you do choose to start that podcast or YouTube channel.\nHopefully some of you’ll click on the link and sign up. Then that’ll be making me some affiliate income from Skillshare =).\nSo in terms of how hard it is to make $100 a month through affiliates, I’d say it’s pretty difficult. It’s easiest if you’ve an already existing audience. Like I’ve said, the way to build an audience is by creating useful content and putting it out for free on the Internet.\nDo this consistently for a few years and I guarantee you’ll have an audience. Then you’ll be able to make some kind of money by leveraging it. But that’s quite hard to do. Very few people manage to stick to content creation with the consistency it requires in the long-term.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from affiliate marketing?\n\nThe good news is once you’ve started making money from affiliates, it’s actually quite easy to maintain. Especially if you’re making evergreen content for your audience, the sort that they’d want to engage with no matter how long ago it was published.\nThat kind of content can become a good source of relatively passive income. It’ll keep attracting new viewers and listeners. These could potentially become sources of affiliate income.\nHow much do I make from affiliate marketing?\nThese days my business makes around $11,000 per month in affiliate income from Skillshare. This approximates to around $2750 per week.\nOn average, we make around $450 per month from Amazon’s UK store. We make a little bit more from the Canada and US stores.\nIf you want to learn more about how to make money from affiliate marketing, you can check out this course taught by Pat Flynn. Pat’s also the founder of the Smart Passive Income platform.\n5) Sell a digital product\nDigital products are products that you create once, like an e-book or an app. Once you’ve created it, you can sell it as many times as you like. This is because selling digital products doesn’t usually have any cost associated with it.\nOne really good example is this guy called Traf who I follow on Twitter.  In 2020, Traf made an iOS 14 icon set and sold it online for $28 a pop. He ended up making $100,000 in less than a week.\nLoads of people wanted to buy his icon pack and you can still buy it for the updated iOs. He put in the work of creating the pack once. Then he made loads of money by distributing it digitally.\nAnother example is my YouTuber friend Oliur. He’s made over $600,000 since 2014 selling his website themes for Tumblr. To find out more about just how he’s managed to make all that money, check out his episode of Deep Dive with Ali Abdaal.\nHow hard is it to make a digital product?\n\nTechnically, anyone can write an e-book and that’d count as a digital product. So it doesn’t have to be particularly difficult.\nBut like I said, money’s an exchange of value. So obviously the thing that you’re selling has to provide enough value for people to want to buy it. That’s often quite hard, especially if you don’t have any experience with creating a product.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month by selling a digital product?\n\nIt’s very easy to create an e-book. Getting people to actually buy it is a whole different ball game. This applies to whatever product you create, whether it’s a website theme, an app, or an icon set.\nThe market around this stuff is very competitive. Your product has to be genuinely really good for people to want to buy it. The way to make a good product is to first identify a problem that people have. Then you find a way to solve the problem and charge money for it.\nIf you can do those three things, then making $100 a month is doable. You just genuinely have to be selling a product that solves a pain point well enough for people to want to buy it. I won’t say it’s easy to make $100 a month, but it’s very doable.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from a digital product?\n\nWhile you’d have to maintain your product a little bit, that’s often much easier to do than creating the product in the first place.\n6) Sell an online course\nAn online course is a type of digital product that’s generally in video format. I’ve multiple online courses that I sell across various platforms like my Part-Time Youtuber Academy and the courses I offer through Skillshare.\nHow hard is it to make an online course?\n\nIt’s not that hard to make an online course. Generally, you’d need to know how to do video but you could potentially even film the entire course on your phone. Stick your phone on a tripod, talk into the camera and teach something. So it’s not too difficult to create a course.\nTo get your course out in the world you can just go through a platform like Skillshare. Anyone can upload a class to Skillshare provided it meets certain quality requirements. It’s a lot easier than making your own website and creating your own platform.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month selling an online course?\n\nTo actually make money from a course, you’ve to make a good one. It has to be something people will want to pay for. You can also avoid having to charge for your online courses by using a platform like Skillshare.\nLike I mentioned, I’ve got 13 classes on Skillshare. I’ve been teaching on the platform since September 2019.\nI also pay for Skillshare and have been doing so for years, even after I started teaching on it. It’s genuinely a fantastic place to learn stuff. They’ve got thousands of classes on all sorts of topics.\nOf the 13 courses I’ve got on Skillshare, five are about productivity. These cover a range of topics including the fundamentals of productivity, the productivity equation that I personally use, and productivity for creators.\nI also have two courses on how you can study for exams if you’re in school. Those have been rated quite highly. If you use my link to register for Skillshare you can also get 30% off the premium membership. That’s a pretty good deal. Then you can access all of my classes.\nI love putting my courses on Skillshare because then I don’t have to directly charge for them. To make $100 a month on Skillshare, you need about 1700 minutes (or 28 hours) of watch time.\nIf you have a one-hour class on Skillshare, you need 28 premium members to watch it every month. This is based on my Skillshare figures over the nearly four years I’ve been on the platform.\nHow hard is it to get 28 students a month watching your class? Well if your class is actually good, it shouldn’t be too hard.\nIf you’ve an existing audience, it’s very easy to get that many students. People already know, like, and trust you. You’ve already built goodwill with them. So they’ll watch your stuff and give you a shot.\nThe good thing about Skillshare is that they’ve their own algorithm. The better a course, the more visible it is. If you genuinely have a really good class then, even if you don’t have an audience, there’s still a high chance that people will watch it.\nWhen members give your class high ratings, it’ll rise to the top and be visible on the Skillshare homepage. If people search for topics related to your class, the platform will also recommend it to them.\nThe other way of making $100 a month from an online course is to just charge $100 for it. Then you just need one sale every month. How hard is it to get one person a month to buy your course for that amount? Again, that depends on how good the course is.\nThe world of online education is exploding right now. Every year, more and more money is being spent on online education, especially since the pandemic. So if you’ve a valuable skill that you can teach, courses are one of the best ways of making passive income.\nIt’s fun to create a course. You can teach stuff and you don’t need too many technical skills. You also don’t need to make a website, you can just shove it on Skillshare.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from your online course?\n\nOnce you’ve managed to start making $100 from your course every month, it’s actually quite easy to maintain that income. You don’t really need to update it too often, perhaps once in a while. You just need to make sure you’re getting a reasonable amount of traffic to the course that grows over time.\nHow much do I make from my online courses?\nThe vast majority of my online courses, at least the very passive ones, are hosted on Skillshare. Those make between $60,000 and $65,000 every month.\nI literally do nothing for my Skillshare classes once I’ve made them. At most, I’ll reply to comments and occasionally plug them in my YouTube videos. That comes to about $15,000 per week. This makes the bulk of the $27,000 passive income that my business generates per week.\n7) Build a membership community\nThis isn’t a route I’d recommend unless you’ve that existing audience we keep coming back to. Everything becomes easier when you’ve an existing audience.\nAgain, the way to gain that audience is by very consistently creating valuable content over a long period of time. That audience knows, likes, and trusts you. So when you ask them to sign up to your Patreon, some people are actually going to.\nWhen talking about Patreon, we can use my friend Hannah Witton’s example. Hannah’s a YouTuber with over 700,000 subscribers to her channel. She has around 937 patrons. Going by her public Patreon stats, this means she’s making somewhere between $3000 and $7000 per month in passive income.\nKeep in mind, only 937 people have signed up to be her patrons out of an audience of 700,000. That’s one person in every 700 subscribers. If those stats represent an accurate average, that means you need a big audience to make a significant amount of money from Patreon.\nAgain, this also depends on how much you’re charging patrons and exactly what value you’re providing.\nThe other way of building a membership community is by creating a value proposition that’s compelling enough for people to want access to it. An example of someone who did this is my friend Anne-Laure Le Cunff, who runs a website called Ness Labs.\nNess Labs has a paid membership community which’s about $9 a month. Anne-Laure started the website in 2019 and had zero audience at the time. She just wrote 100 blog posts over 100 working days and built up an audience.\nIn March 2020, Ness Labs launched the membership. Within a year they had passed $100,000 in annual recurring revenue. That was pretty awesome, considering she’d started less than two years before.\nHow hard is it to start a membership community?\n\nIt’s actually very easy to start a membership community. You just make an account on some kind of membership platform like Patreon. Making money from that community is then a whole different ball game.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from a membership community?\n\nTo make $100 a month, you need to provide $100 worth of value to potential members of the community. That’s actually quite hard to do.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from a membership community?\n\nThe nice thing is once you’ve figured out the right formula, it’s actually a lot easier to maintain that income. This is because of the way the economics of membership communities work. If you keep showing up and providing value in some capacity, you’ll be able to retain the members that’ve already signed up.\nHow much do I make from my membership communities?\nFor my business, we’ve a membership community for our Part-Time YouTuber Academy alumni. We call it the Part-Time YouTuber Inner Circle and make roughly $2800 a week from our members.\nBut it’s not very passive. We have a few events every week and coworking events on Zoom twice a day, along with lots of other stuff. So it takes a lot of work,\n8) Start a business and automate it\nAnother way to generate passive income is to create a business that sells goods or services. Then you can automate or delegate aspects of that business so that the income that you generate from it’s reasonably passive.\nThis is the stuff that Tim Ferriss talks a lot about in The 4-Hour Workweek. There’re a number of businesses that you can start in which you’d be selling a good or service and can delegate, outsource, automate in intelligent ways to make the income passive.\nAgain, using my friend Oliur as an example: on his YouTube channel, Oliur talks about his $1,000,000 Shopify store. He designs, manufactures, and sells cool vegan leather products like bags and desk accessories. Loads of work went into setting the store up but now he’s got a team that manages it. So he spends proportionally less of his time running that business.\nEqually, if you’re going down the service route: I’ve got a friend who runs an Instagram and Facebook ads marketing agency. His clients pay him a few hundreds dollars a month to manage their Facebook and Instagram ads.\nHe initially has to put in the work to set up the ads. After that it’s automated. He’s got a team that he delegates to. He also uses tools like Zapier to automate aspects of the business. So each month he has to do a very small amount of actual work to keep the business ticking along.\nHow hard is it to start your own business?\n\nCreating a business is quite difficult. You’ve got to identify a way to genuinely provide value to people. Then you’ve to find a way to fund your operations. It’s like opening a whole can of worms.\nHow hard is it to earn $100 from a business?\n\nAgain, to make money from your business you’ve to be able to provide value and that’s hard. It’s not as easy as making an account on a stock market platform and just putting some money into various businesses. You actually have to give value to people.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from your own business?\n\nLike with anything, once you get started and get the business up and running, maintenance is a little bit easier.\n9) Build an app or website\nLastly, you can also try to generate passive income by building an app, website, or some kind of software product. You can sell these with one-off payments or, as is more common these days, as a subscription service.\nThere’s a whole category of such products called SAS — software as a service.\nIf you look at the website indiehackers.com, there are hundreds of people who make passive income through software businesses. They talk about how they got started and share tips.\nIn fact, two years ago I was interviewed on an episode of the Indie Hackers podcast. That was really cool because I’d been following the them for years. I was interviewed around the concept of starting an online course like the Part-Time YouTuber Academy.\nHow hard is it to build an app or website?\n\nI’ve had a bit of personal experience with this.\nWhen I was still in university, me and my brother made two websites called BMAT Ninja and UCAT Ninja. These basically offered softwares as services. They were question banks for students applying to medical school, to help them do well in admissions tests.\nWorking over the summer of 2015, we coded the websites completely from scratch, having learnt to code when we were young. In the beginning, I think we made about $10,000 in a year. It was pretty good money but it was a lot of hard work.\nMaking an app or software is actually quite hard. For one thing, you’ve to know how to code. You also have to come with an idea that’s compelling. Then you’ve to actually build it, which takes a lot of work.\nHow hard is it to make $100 a month from your app or website?\n\nOnce you’ve made an app, getting people to pay for it is an entirely different kettle of fish. You’ve to market it and convince people to buy it, which can be quite hard.\nHow hard is it to maintain an income from your app or website?\n\nAs with everything else on this list, once you’ve created the app and begun to sell it successfully, maintenance is a little bit easier."

    "article_body": "YouTube’s highest earner last year made just shy of £22 million ($31 million). This is ridiculous. Especially as he’s only 9 years old. But it just goes to show that YouTube can be a brilliant way to make money. If a toy-loving kid can earn more than most professional footballers, I’m pretty sure we all have some skill or interest we can share with the world. And maybe profit from by monetising your youtube channel.\nWith over 2 billion monthly users, YouTube offers all creators a chance to find their audience and monetise their passion. So, whether you’re a gamer, a baker, a prankster, or an overly enthusiastic productivity nerd like me, starting a YouTube channel (and taking it seriously) might be the best thing you ever do.\n6 Ways to Make Money on YouTube\nIn June 2017, after finishing my fifth year at Cambridge, I decided it’d be a bit of fun to start a YouTube channel. As it turns out, this is by far one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. What had started out as an enjoyable part-time hobby now makes a ridiculous amount of money.\n\nSo what’s the secret to my success? Other than luck, unfair advantages, and a large amount of privilege, I understood YouTube’s potential as both a generator (through display ads) and a facilitator (via off-site earnings) for making money.\nAnd while there are literally thousands of great ways to start making money on YouTube, I’ve found that the following 6 methods are the best place to start:\n\nThe YouTube Partner Program (YPP)\nSponsorships\nAffiliates\nCommunity Earnings\nOnline Courses\nMerchandise\n\nFrom this list then, the only way we can directly generate money through our channel is the YPP. The other 5 methods are facilitators, which require us to build an audience who know, like and trust us before we’re able to make any decent amount of money from them.\nSo, there’s no shortcut to success. We have to commit to consistently creating useful content over a long period of time – building a strong relationship with our audience – before we can monetise them effectively using the methods outlined below.\n 1. YouTube Partner Program (YPP)\nAcceptance on to the YouTube Partner Program (YPP) lets us begin showing ads on our video content, and it’s the simplest route to begin monetising our channel.\nHowever, there are 2 requirements we’ve got to meet before qualifying for the program:\n\nWe need to have 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months AND\nWe need at least 1000 subscribers.\n\nOnce we’ve reached this threshold, connected our channel to Google AdSense, and met the relevant policies and guidelines, YouTube will review our application and invite us to run ads.\nHaving said that, this isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme. It can take months to get to this point. In fact, I made 77 videos before I could turn monetisation on, which – truth be told – was a bit of a slog. I could’ve easily given up. And in 10 months I had made an admittedly pathetic total of £1.96 ($2.70).\nBut the wait was totally worth it. Over the next six months I made over £6,100 ($8,500) and this number has kept growing ever since.\nIn 2020, I made over £100,000 ($140,000) from AdSense.\n\n\nHow much can we expect to make from AdSense?\nBroadly speaking, YouTube pays about £1-2 ($2) per 1000 views, but this number varies hugely based on watch time, the length of the video, and the type of content produced (which we’ll talk about in a later article).\nTo account for this uncertainty, successful YouTubers recognise the huge potential of off-platform earnings. AdSense will only ever make up a small slice of their earnings, so getting sponsors or affiliates is a great place for them to level up their monetisation strategy and see their earnings soar.\n 2. Sponsorships\nFuelled by the gradual decline in TV viewership in recent years, many businesses are turning to YouTubers to help them advertise their products and services. Usually this is done as a sponsored video.\nAlthough sponsorship agreements can vary, they’re usually straightforward – brands pay the creator a lump sum in exchange for a mention or product placement in an upcoming video. And, if they’re feeling especially generous, they sometimes offer a bonus or a reward for additional video engagement or sales.\nBut landing a brand deal can take some time. My first sponsored video came one year after starting on YouTube. At the time, I’d created nearly 150 videos and had around 50,000 subscribers. So to begin with it’s a real struggle.\nFortunately, after a couple of years of struggling to find sponsors, my friend Thomas Frank kindly introduced me to an agency, Standard, which I’ve been part of since October 2019 (and I’m now a co-owner of it!). Standard find new sponsors for me every month, and they’ve been a huge help in connecting me with some pretty awesome brands (such as Notion, Brilliant, Skillshare, and so on).\nNow although I can’t share exact figures here about my own sponsorship arrangements, in my video on How Much I Earned in 2020 I revealed my ballpark earnings from sponsors to be roughly £130,000 ($180,000) last year.\n\nHow much can we expect to make through sponsorships?\nGrapevine Village have a great blog post on this. They explain that if we’re a YouTuber and we want to land a brand deal with a business, we should charge £15-20 ($20-30) CPM (cost per mille). In other words, per 1000 video views we can expect to make between £15 and £20.\nSo if we normally get 100,000 views on a video, we should be charging £1500-2000 ($2000-$3000).However, this isn’t a hard and fast rule, with the biggest YouTubers making well in excess of £70,000 ($100,000) per video. Not gonna lie, that’s pretty insane.\n 3. Affiliates\nUnlike sponsorships, affiliate income is something that we can start earning as a relatively new YouTuber, as long as we’ve built an audience who know, like, and trust us.\nThe idea is that certain companies are willing to provide a small commission for driving sales of their product or service. This is tracked using a unique identifier link (e.g. https://iqunix.store/?ac=ali) that’s plugged in our content. So the more sales we rack up for them, the more money we ultimately make in return.\nTo begin with, we’ve got to start small.\nBefore I had any significant audience growth, I opted in to a few affiliate programs, like the Amazon affiliate marketing program. At this stage I was only making a few pennies each week, but as my audience grew, so did my earnings.\nHaving more subscribers means that people trust us enough to actually click the affiliate links, but it also adds weight to our recommendations. After all, we’re probably more likely to listen to the recommendation of a friend than the recommendation of some shady-looking website. Pretty simple really.\nThen once we’ve built our audience and our reputation, we can begin reaching out to bigger brands that offer larger commissions. And it’s likely that just a handful of them will make us any significant amount of money. For me, that’s been Paperlike, the IQUNIX keyboard, and Epidemic Sounds (yep, those are affiliate links lol).\nIn fact, in 2020 the affiliate income I made from my top 5 affiliate partnerships was greater than the money I made from AdSense (£130,000 vs. £100,000). It’s a similar story for Nat Eliason. Just 4 of his affiliate programs account for 90-95% of the affiliate revenue for his site:\n\nHow much can we expect to make from affiliates?\nThe average affiliate commission rate sits around 5-25%, but that tells us very little about potential earnings. You see, it also depends on the price of the products we promote and the number of sales we expect to generate. Therefore, the following formula offers us a far more accurate way of answering this question:\nEarnings = commission earned per sale x number of expected sales\n 4. Community Earnings\nOnce we’ve built a sizeable audience, it’s possible to make decent amounts of money creating a community space for them to engage and interact with exclusive content.\nOne of the most popular methods of doing this is using Patreon.\nPatreon is a membership platform that lets our fans become active participants in our work and discover behind-the-scenes content for a small monthly fee. Although there are other sites doing similar stuff (e.g. Buy Me a Coffee and Ko-fi), this site is probably the most popular for YouTubers.\nFor example, my friends Matt D’Avella and Hannah Witton both have Patreon accounts, with membership levels ranging from £3-10 ($4-11). Matt’s Patreon gives you access to his ‘Secret Podcast’ and a slack community of like-minded self-development enthusiasts, while Hannah provides members with early video access, live streams, and a private discord server.The other method is to create a private community on a self-hosted platform. This is something that Ness Labs is doing really well. Their community for thoughtful conversation surpassed 2000 paying members and $9000 in monthly recurring revenue in February 2021, less than 12 months after its launch.\n\n\nHow much can we expect to earn from our community?\nAs Patreon is probably the easiest way to create a paying community, let’s focus on that. There’s an excellent blog post on this topic, but essentially if 1-5% of our fans become members paying an average of £5 ($7), it’s not too hard to estimate potential earnings. With 30,000 followers, for instance, we’re going to make somewhere between £200 and £1000 ($300-1500):\n\n 5. Online Courses\nThere’s been a large uptick in the number of people turning to online education in the previous 12 months. And smart creators have been capitalising on this by sharing their own knowledge through digital courses.\nBy building an audience who like and trust us, many of them are going to be interested in learning the skills and expertise we have developed along the way. Online courses are therefore a great way for us to teach our fans while making some money too.\nI’ve found that there are two great ways to do this:\n\nSkillshare classes\nSelf-hosted online courses\nLive cohorts.\n\nSkillshare\nSkillshare is sort of like the Netflix of online courses. So Premium users pay something like £7/month ($10/month), giving them access to a huge range of videos to learn just about anything they want. Then if those users watch one of our courses, we’ll get paid a few pennies for every minute they stick around. This really adds up over time.\nAs an example, in my first month of Skillshare in January 2020 I had one course and made a total of (£2200) $3100. Just 12 months later, in January 2021, I made a whopping £50,000 ($69,500).\nBut, the problem with Skillshare is that for a 3-hour (ish) class we’re only going to get paid about $3-4 per student. So we’re going to need a large number of people to watch our courses to make it worthwhile. This isn’t easy when we’re just starting out.\nInstead, it may be better to create a self-hosted online course.\nSelf-hosted online courses\nWhen we self-host courses, using something like Podia, we can charge a lot more. Plus, we can design the course and the landing page to look exactly like we want it to.\nFor example, I have a space on my own website where wannabe medics can access my online video courses for the UCAT, BMAT, and Interviews. By doing this, I’m able to charge about £100 ($140) per student. That’s much more than on Skillshare.\nSimilarly, my friend Nat Eliason has a fantastic self-hosted course (Effortless Output in Roam). As does Tiago Forte (Get Stuff Done Like a Boss). They’ve got nicely branded websites, individualised pricing, and have complete control over their audience. Ideal for building trust and forging deeper relationships with their fans, while making some extra money.\nLive cohorts\nIf we’re confident that we can generate enough interest from our audience, we can create a live course. This is a big step and the holy grail of making money through courses. Even I was initially scared of the idea of charging money to run a live cohort, until David Perell and Tiago Forte reassured me that I’d enjoy it.\nAs a side note – Both of these guys have brilliant live courses of their own that you should check out: Write of Passage and Building a Second Brain (and yes, these are affiliate links too, of course).\nSo in November 2020 I launched the Part-Time YouTuber Academy. On the course, students learn how to grow their YouTube channel from 0 to 100,000+ subscribers and turn it into a sustainable, income-generating machine. I only expected about 5-10 people to sign up, but in the end we had 360 paying customers. And it became a really wholesome, lovely community.\nThe £220,000 ($310,000) in revenue was a nice bonus .\n\nHow much can we expect to earn from online courses?\nThis is difficult to answer as it depends on many factors: how much we charge, the size of our audience, and the likely conversion rate. Although conversion rates for online courses are mostly determined by the amount our fans trust and like us, a conservative estimate would be 1-2%. From this, our expected earnings can be calculated as follows:\nRevenue = Number of your Audience x Conversion Rate x Price of the Course\n 6. Merchandise\nThe final method for making money through our YouTube channel is to sell merchandise (or ‘merch’ for short).\nCreating and selling our own physical products is perhaps the most difficult method of monetising our creative work, as we need to find a manufacturer, design the product, market it, and so on. But, many content creators make it work.\nFor example, my friend Ruby Granger has a fantastic YouTube channel all about studying, and she also runs a small online store called Pumpkin Productivity. By building a YouTube audience of (mostly) students, she’s been able to seamlessly promote academic essentials to them and make a healthy side-income for herself.\n\nI’ve been thinking about selling stuff too – perhaps some sort of productivity journal – but I’ve found it to be a lot of effort for the expected returns. So, for the minute, it’s in my maybe pile.\nHow much can you expect to earn from selling merchandise?\nTo make this profitable we need to, both, sell a lot and minimise the cost of production. And without a big audience and a large upfront investment, this is tricky.\nBut if we really wanted to give it a go, the average YouTuber with approximately 10,000 subscribers can expect to sell 6 products each month. That’s about $70 ().\nConclusion\nSo there we have it. The earning potential on YouTube is massive, and there’s much more we can do than running a few ads. Monetising our channels effectively also means running courses, working with sponsors and affiliates, and growing membership communities. It means thinking outside the box and trying out new things.\nThe most crucial element, however, is enjoying ourselves and staying consistent. I started this journey as a Cambridge medical student and a junior doctor who just wanted to help people to study better. It wasn’t about the money.\nThe money was a by-product of having fun and putting in the work.\nNever in a million years did I expect to be making this much through YouTube, but by using these 6 methods (and signing up for the next cohort of the PTYA ), there’s no reason why you can’t do the same."

    "article_body": "Tomorrow – A mystical land where 99% of all human productivity, motivation and achievement are stored\nRegardless of how many productivity books we’ve bought (and haven’t read) or how many motivational videos we’ve watched (and never acted upon), we all struggle at some point during our lives with the productivity plague of the modern era – procrastination.\nIn fact, procrastination is not new. Ancient Greek philosophers developed a word for it – akrasia – meaning to act against our better judgement by doing one thing even though we know we should be doing something else. Since then, this innate affliction to act against our better judgement, delay necessary action and procrastinate over our personal tasks has evolved to such an extent that the humour of the opening quote really comes from the fact that it’s so painfully true.\nIn this post, we’ll discuss (1) Why we all procrastinate, (2)How we can stop procrastinating.\nWhy do we procrastinate?\nProcrastination is a perfect example of present bias.\nPresent bias is the idea that even though we can set as many goals for our future self as we want, it’s our present self that has to do the action to get there. Unfortunately, our brains aren’t wired to appreciate long term benefits and our present self will always prefer short-term pleasures in the form of instant gratification which often comes at the expense of longer term outcomes.\nHere’s what a 2013 study called procrastination:\nProcrastination is the primacy of short-term mood repair … over the longer-term pursuit of intended actions.\nIn other words, procrastination is about being more focused on the immediate urgency of managing negative moods and pushing the problem away than getting on with the task in the present moment.\nWhen we put things off until some point in the future (eg: tomorrow, next week or worst of all, ‘at some point’), the tension we feel disappears. The task is lifted off our shoulders. We feel happy that we’ve assigned a time to get the task done, even if that time is ‘at some point in the future’.\nThe confusing thing about procrastination is that, in certain scenarios, we know we can’t afford to procrastinate.\nIn my job as a doctor, I can’t delay treating someone just because it involves doing something unpleasant, or if it means I have to stay overtime.\nBut when I have the space and freedom to manage my own time, suddenly that world of distraction and the ability to make excuses to myself means that I feel able to offload many tasks onto my future self.\nAnd yet we know that procrastination isn’t good for us.\nDelaying tasks that we simply have to do is going to catch up with us at some point. Especially if those tasks have deadlines, or carry consequences for not doing them. Eventually we’ll feel the effects of our delaying tactics.\nSo what can we do about procrastination and how can we stop procrastinating?\nWell, for me, understanding the truth behind two key factors – motivation and momentum – and using a couple of simple rules – the two minute rule and the ten minute rule – have all helped reduce the burden that procrastination brings to my life.\nMotivation\nIt’s typical to hear people say I just can’t summon up the motivation, I wish I had more motivation or I need some motivation to start.\nSource: Screw Motivation What You Need is Discipline\nThe truth is, we’ve got motivation wrong.\nMotivation is not the spark or the cause of action, it’s the result of that action.\nAs Jeff Haden says in his book ‘The Motivation Myth‘\nMotivation isn’t something you have, motivation is something you get, automatically, from feeling good about achieving small successes.\nIf action is conditional on feelings, waiting for the right mood becomes a particularly insidious form of procrastination. Whether we like to admit it or not, motivation is basically a myth.\nSo, if not motivation, then what?\nI’ve started to replace the idea of motivation with that of discipline. Discipline is like an engine that, once started, actually supplies energy to our system. It also creates habits which means that we don’t have to rely on willpower alone to try to summon up some short term burst of energy.\nIn essence, discipline produces action which leads to a more sustainable form of motivation.\nSource: Procrastination: A Scientific Guide on How to Stop Procrastinating\nOvercoming or getting past the idea of ‘finding’ motivation can help you get started. Getting started is the key factor for the other critical idea – Momentum.\nMomentum\nThe resistance we have to a task is usually at its greatest before we begin. The simple thought of starting and overcoming that resistance is where procrastination thrives.\nIn fact, Steven Pressfield in his book, THE WAR OF ART, describes this feeling of ‘the resistance’ as a universal force that has one sole mission: to keep things as they are, preventing action, creativity and progress.\nIn other words, resistance provides the beating heart of procrastination.\nBUT as soon as we start, as soon as we cross the action line, the pain begins to subside. The problem is not doing the work but just starting the work.\nMomentum can’t build up by putting something off. A ball can’t start rolling down a hill until you push it over the edge but once you’ve pushed it over the edge, it builds momentum and is difficult to stop.\nSource: Procrastination: A Scientific Guide on How to Stop Procrastinating\nJames Clear calls this the physics of productivity because of how it relates to Newton’s First Law of Motion or the Law of Inertia which states that:\nEvery body remains in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force.\nWhen we’re procrastinating we’re in a state of rest – motivation doesn’t start the ball rolling. Only action can act as the external unbalanced force to push us into a state of motion. Once moving, a feedback loop develops and it becomes harder to stop because the desire to complete tasks provides the drive necessary to continue moving forward.\nAs soon as I realised this, I began to be more mindful of developing this momentum. It reinforces the importance of starting, in whatever way possible, because any action will start the ball rolling, making subsequent actions easier and procrastination more difficult.\nThe Two Rules for Beating Procrastination\nFor many of us, procrastination usually revolves around tasks that are either:\n\nSmall and annoying OR\nLarge and daunting.\n\nAfter learning to appreciate the importance of motivation and momentum, I’ve found two techniques that are particularly helpful in overcoming each of these types of task: the two-minute rule and the ten-minute rule.\nThe Two-Minute Rule\nThe two-minute rule is a concept put forward by productivity guru David Allen in his book Getting Things Done. The main idea is that, if we have a pending task that can be completed in less than two minutes then we should do it right away. No hesitation, no delay. If it’ll take longer than two minutes we should write it down on a list to return to when we have more time.\nIt’s as simple as that.\nThis strategy of time management eliminates unnecessary procrastination over small chores or tasks and reduces the clutter in our brain that distracts us from the bigger picture.\nThe 10-Minute Rule\nClearly there are some tasks that we can’t just complete in two minutes. Planning, writing and filming a whole YouTube video can’t be completed in two minute segments. Writing a thesis would be difficult to complete in 2 minute intervals. Creating a presentation at work is difficult to create in 2 minutes. You get the idea.\nHowever, if we do find ourselves procrastinating over these larger, more daunting tasks, the other technique I use to get started is the 10-minute rule.\nThe 10-minute rule is simple. If I’m finding myself procrastinating from something I have to do, I tell myself that I’m just going to do it for 10 minutes. No more, no less. Just 10 minutes.\nBut the power behind this technique goes back to the idea of momentum.\nOnce I’ve got going, having done 10 minutes, I don’t want to stop especially when I’m making progress. Suddenly momentum builds up, one task leads to another which leads to another. Obviously, you might be bored after 10 minutes but we don’t like leaving tasks half-done and so 10 minutes quickly turns into 20, then 30 and suddenly you’re making progress.\nSome people call this the 30 minute rule, the 20 minute rule, the 5 minute rule – it doesn’t really matter what it’s called, the idea is the same: we’re tricking our brain into getting started because we think we won’t be doing it for long.\n\nFundamentally, overcoming procrastination is about maintaining discipline, generating momentum and ensuring that the tasks that you need to do on any given day are achievable and manageable.\nDespite the advice that I’ve given in this article, I still struggle with moments of procrastination. We all do.\nProcrastination is a character flaw that we all have. What matters is that we can recognise it, learn to manage it, develop strategies to overcome it and create a system that minimises the opportunity for it to emerge in the future – that’s something we can all start developing today, or maybe leave it till tomorrow…"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nThis week, I spent quite a lot of time on Zoom chatting to a bunch of people familiar with the book-writing world. It’s been both reassuring and alarming.\nIt’s reassuring because it’s just nice to know that there’s a pool of experts where I can get feedback and share my concerns. I feel super lucky to have met these generous people who are so ready to jump on a call and offer me solid advice that keeps me typing away.\nBut it’s also been alarming because I often get conflicting advice about how to shape the book. I’ve had some conversations that made me wonder hm… should I change the premise of my book? Tbh, I didn’t expect to have these existential questions at this stage of the writing process…\n What we worked on this week\nThe good news is that the existential crises are now solved, but it made me wonder whether I’m too fickle with ideas. This happens quite often to me: wake up thinking that Idea X is gamechanging and revolutionary; have lunch with someone who challenges Idea X; go home doing a 180 on Idea X.\nRelatedly, this week, we worked on how doubt (a lack of certainty/conviction) can be a source of procrastination. The idea is that a lot of the times, what holds us back from getting something done isn’t how difficult that task is. Rather, it’s our doubts about whether we can do it that holds us back.\n The most interesting thing we learned\nAs part of our research, we revisited Adam Grant’s book Originals. In his Ted talk on the habits of original thinkers, Adam says that there are 2 kinds of doubt:\n\nSelf-doubt: This is what happens when you doubt your ability to do something. It might sound something like I’m not creative enough to write a book or I’m not fit enough to train for a marathon.\nIdea-doubt: This is what happens when you doubt an idea (and, crucially, not your ability). It might sound something like Hm… this idea for the book isn’t great right now or I’m not sure training for a marathon is a good idea because of my bad knees, maybe I’ll train for a swimming competition instead.\n\nYou can probably guess what kind of doubt is more damaging. As Adam says in his talk:\nI discovered that there are two different kinds of doubt, self-doubt and idea-doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing, it leaves you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test, experiment, to refine.\nQuestion of the week\nWe’d love to get your thoughts on self-doubt and whether it’s gotten in the way of you doing things you want to do. If you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here. We’ll be asking you questions like:\nHas self-doubt ever gotten in the way of you doing something you really wanted to do?When you experience doubt, what are the main reasons for this?Do you have any techniques to deal with self-doubt?\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on anxiety where we asked you about your experiences of anxiety and whether you have any tips and strategies to deal with it. We read through all your responses!\nThanks to Adam for sharing how a subtle mindset shift can be helpful:\nI remind myself that this is a physiological response that is designed to heighten my sense… By focusing on the narration in my head and changing the narrative hey this is helping you think better, even if it feels very uncomfortable it helps numb that overwhelming feeling.\nThanks to Kaloyan for showing how awareness of breath can be a tool to get away from your mind:\nBreathing can help — just awareness of breathing, realizing that I am here, and not wherever my thoughts make it seem like I am.\nAnd thanks to Liah for sharing how channeling anxiety into creative projects (e.g. growing your YouTube channel, planning videos) can be a way to release that anxiety\nWith increasing levels of stress, I turn to my creative projects and start putting in a ton of time and focus into them. It helps block out the thoughts of the cause of my stress, and allows that energy to flow in a different, but still productive and non-wasteful direction. It’s really like stress/anxious energy are channeled to where I point them.\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nLast week went down really well on the writing front. We went on a team retreat in Wales and stayed in this amazing Air BnB. The goal I set for myself was to write a draft for Parts I and II of the book during the retreat.\nI embraced the crappy first draft mindset completely and just hammered out those words. Of course, there were times when that inner critic wouldn’t leave me alone. And there were times when I would literally type out Uh oh, this is really bad… but let’s keep going on the page.\nBy the end of the week, I had a draft of Parts I and II. They might be crappy, but those words exist.\n(Check out this vlog for some behind-the-scenes)\n\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we’ve been thinking about how teaching and mentoring others can be a source of energy.\nI used to work in a teaching hospital and there were days when younger medical students would follow me around to get an insight of what practising medicine is like day-to-day. I thought that having extra medical students follow me around would just add to the already heavy workload of a doctor. But I felt super energised on the days when I had medical students following me.\nWhy did I feel more energised even though I was technically working more?\n The most interesting thing we learned\nThere’s this phenomenon called helper’s high that psychologists have discovered. It describes that feeling of wow after doing an act of kindness, donating money to charitable, or volunteering in a meaningful way.\nIt turns out that when we choose to spend our time on activities that benefit other people, we also feel energized. Studies have shown that volunteering increases happiness, life satisfaction, self esteem, decreases depression, and might even help us live longer.\nQuestion of the week\nHave you ever experienced the helper’s high? If you’ve ever taught or mentored other people, I’d love to hear about what that did for you. Teaching and mentoring doesn’t have to be formal like having a medical student follow you. It can be you helping a younger sibling with homework, teaching a friend to cook, anything that comes to your mind.\nShare here: Whatever your story is, if you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here. As usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on mindfulness and meditation! Shoutout to Chris, Anh, and Arun for sharing these cool mindfulness practices.\nChris introduced the 5-4-3-2-1 technique:\nI use 5-4-3-2-1 to break out of moments where I feel anxious or have lots of nervous energy. Using this technique, I focus on my breathing while listing 5 things I can see, 4 things I can touch, 3 things I can hear, 2 things I can smell and 1 thing I can taste.\nAnh uses an alarm as a prompt to practice gratitude:\nI set an alarm for every hour or two. Whenever the phone rings, I stop whatever I’m doing to look around, find something I’m grateful for in my environment so I can be more mindful where I am and what I’m doing, or just enjoy the silence (essentially a mini mediation session) for just 1 minute. Then I resume and repeat.\nAnd Arun spoke about the art of listening:\nWhenever I become aware that I got carried away with the thought process, missing the present moment. I become aware of the sound surrounding me. For example, a bird singing, sound of the vehicle passing through the road side.\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nLately, I’ve been experimenting with writing at night and it’s working surprisingly well. It’s a tip that I got from our editor Rachel who says that our creative juices get going at different times in the day. I’ve been having moments late in the evening where I feel like I’m in the zone with writing… fingers crossed it lasts.\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we looked at the emotional blockers that lead to procrastination. We typically think of procrastination as being an issue with our willpower and grit. And most of us believe this about productivity gurus: if something needs to be done, they’ll make the time for it and check it off the to-do list. But what if the story is more complex than that?\n The most interesting thing we learned\nA while back, I read this quote by Dr. Tim Pychyl, professor of psychology at Carleton University in Ottawa, and it still really resonates with me:\nProcrastination is an emotion regulation problem, not a time management problem.\nOur friend Tim is basically saying – hey, what if procrastination isn’t a problem with us, our time management, or our willpower? What if procrastination is our way of coping with negative emotions that we feel when doing certain things – emotions like anxiety, stress, self-doubt, boredom?\nIf procrastination is an emotion regulation problem rather than a time management one, then when we find ourselves procrastinating this could be a signal for us to rethink. It signals to us that the thing we’re procrastinating from is probably triggering some challenging emotions within us. Figuring our what those negative emotions are is important. It might help us realize that the task we’re procrastinating from isn’t quite right for us. Or maybe help us realize that we need to change our mindset towards that task, like lowering our expectations about the outcome.\nQuestion of the week\nMindfulness techniques are one way to become more aware of the (positive or negative) emotions that we’re experiencing. I would love to hear about your experiences of mindfulness and meditation. Maybe, like me, you’ve struggled to stick with meditation and found some other ways of being mindful. Or maybe you’ve done a 10-day meditation retreat.\nWhatever your story is, if you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on self-doubt last week. Shoutout to Mila, Mariana, and Schuchi for sharing these valuable tips on how to get over self-doubt.\nA few of you mentioned that self-doubt is induced by fear of failure. Mila said that reminding yourself that regret is often worse than failing sometimes helps reducing that self-doubt:\nI try to remind myself that inaction is the biggest regret of the dying and so taking no steps towards my goals today, will ultimately lead to regret. and I would rather have tried and failed than have regrets.\nA couple of you mentioned that telling yourself to just do it is a helpful tip. Mariana summarised this nicely using the 5-second rule:\nI like to use Mel Robbin’s 5 second rule, so whenever I feel the self-doubt crippling in I just go 5,4,3,2,1 and do the thing before I can overthink it more\nFinally, Schuchi suggests keeping a small book of reminders that you can do it. I used to do this with nice Youtube comments and whenever I feel a little demotivated to make a video, reading comments about how I’ve done a little bit to help someone out sparks that energy to create.\nMake a small book/ diary to write down such things. Such as when you feel really confident write down very shortly how being in that moment feels, or when you feel happy, motivated etc… During tough times these little reminders of your past are to let you know that you have the ability, and you can do whatever you have thought you want to do.\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "Around a month ago, I went on a retreat with a group of startup founders. One thing we spoke about is how many of us struggle to ask for help.\nA week or so after that retreat, my book editor Rachel said to me: I feel like you don’t ask enough for help. Since then, we’ve started doing additional weekly calls on Thursday evenings to check in on how writing is going. And it’s been great.\nAll of this made me wonder: Am I bad at asking for help when I need it?\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we looked into how people feel about asking for help. It turns out that many of us struggle with asking for help. One thing that holds us back is that we think there’ll be consequences from asking. We think that people might turn us down, might think we’re stupid for asking for help, might think we’re a burden for asking for help, and so on.\n The most interesting thing we learned\nHere’s one really cool hack I learned from the research:\nAsk for advice, not feedback.\nAsking for advice and feedback sound like the same thing, but it turns out that it can give you totally different outcomes. Researchers at the Harvard Business School found that when we ask for advice, we get much more specific and effective input than when we ask for feedback.\nIn one study, they asked participants for their input on a job application letter for a tutoring position. When participants were asked to provide feedback, the input was vague. When participants were asked to provide advice, the input was a lot more critical and actionable. For example, they described the ways in which they could improve their job application – emphasize certain past experiences, describe your tutoring style, explain why you’re well-matched to this tutoring job in particular.\nSo the next time you want some input into something you’re working on, ask for advice rather than feedback.\nQuestion of the week\nDo you struggle with asking for help or does it come quite easily to you? If you’re up for sharing an anecdote or story that might feature in the book, please reply here.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey last week about teaching and mentoring others. We loved all these cool responses about what helping other does for you!\nMike said: I’m a professional executive coach and I love my job for this exact reason. There is no buzz like the buzz of helping people improve their lives. Meaning is found in motion, in service to others.\nAnd Nat said: Being able to offer advice and help students really motivated me because I felt like I knew what I was doing, and it was paying off as I was able to help them learn something too. In my current job, I train clients and staff members and I get that same feeling. I want to be better so I can do better for others.\nHearing about how much people enjoy helping others makes it even more of a puzzle that we’re afraid to ask for help…\n RadReads\nSpeaking of asking for advice, one of my favourite ways of getting advice (without asking for it  is through high-quality newsletters. If you’re into this kind of thing, check out RadReads. We’re going to be doing a swap with them – exciting times!\nRadReads is a weekly newsletter by Khe Hy. Each week, 35,000 subscribers get actionable tips on boosting your creativity, reducing overwhelm and getting more done (by working smarter). Take control of your biggest priorities with Khe’s free email training.\nThat’s it from me for now.

    "article_body": "HHey friends,\nA while ago a friend told me that his most productive writing time is when he’s on holiday. I was skeptical at first. Surely it’s better to do the hardcore writing when you’re in the office in work mode?\nBut I discovered something recently when I went on a surfing trip to Morocco. I was there for 4 days and my goal was to write the first drafts of two chapters, no matter how crappy they turn out.\nI thought I’d get distracted by the surfing lessons and pool-side lounging. But I surprised myself and managed to pull it off…! So now I’m sold on these writing holidays. Let me tell you why I think it worked.\n\nWorking and chilling \n What we worked on this week\nOn holiday, I had limited time to write in between all the fun activities I wanted to do. So I needed to be efficient and productive in the dedicated writing time. This week, we looked at something related to this: the power of having a hard stop.\nDuring a typical office work day, it’s easy to let my dedicated writing time stretch out into the evenings. Say I intend to start at 9am but get distracted by something business-related. I’d tell myself that I’ll restart in the evening when the office quiets down. And my allocated writing time would bloat without much output to show for it. Worse still, I’d feel tired the next day because I worked late into the evening.\nDuring the surfing trip, there was some kind of activity that I wanted to do on most evenings. So I knew there was a chunk of time between the end of my surfing lesson and the start of my evening activity to get things done. I’d have a hard stop to the work day and feel refreshed to restart the next morning before the surfing lessons began.\n The most interesting thing we learned\nLooking into the power of hard stops took me back to this 2008 article by my guru Cal Newport. In the article, Cal talks about his fixed-schedule productivity that helps him juggle multiple projects while doing his PhD at MIT.\nThere are two rules in this system\n\nRule 1: Choose a schedule of work hours that you think provides the ideal balance of effort and relaxation.\nRule 2: Do whatever it takes to avoid violating this schedule.\n\nRule 1 is usually simple. For most people, it might look something like – Work 9 to 5 on weekdays and spend time with family and friends on weekends.\nRule 2 is the tough one. It’s easy to let work spill outside the schedule you set out, meaning it’s no longer a fixed-schedule. But Rule 2 is important because of something called Parkinson’s Law – the idea that work expands to fill the time we allocate to it. If I think I have the evening to write, then I’ll allow myself to slack off in the morning.\nQuestion of the week\nDo you struggle with sticking to a fixed schedule? Have you any tips and tricks to stick to a fixed schedule? Do you have a shut down ritual that tells your brain you’re done for the day?\nIf you’re up for sharing an anecdote or story that might feature in the book, please reply here. As usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey last week about asking for help. Shoutout to Kern for sharing how ego got in the way of asking for help on a kitchen renovation project. It sounds like asking for help helped you not only get a nice kitchen but also made your fiancé happy!\nRecently, I attempted a kitchen renovation at the house that my fiancé and I were about to move into. I am a chemist by profession and I learnt everything about woodworking on YouTube. I refused to ask for advice about something as basic as choosing good quality lumber and because of my ego, I wasted a lot of time…and MONEY.\n​\nEventually, I asked a professional woodworker for advice and he was more than happy to explain to me what I should look out for. Then because I used the proper building material, I successfully completed the cupboards and countertops and my fiancé decided to go forward with the wedding.\nThat’s it from me this week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nOne of my goals this year is to learn Mandarin Chinese. But I’ve been struggling to keep the momentum going. Between book-writing, video-making, and business-running, I’m struggling to find the time to learn a language.\nAt first, I told myself that I’m just procrastinating from it. But recently I had a thought: maybe I’m not procrastinating from it; maybe learning a new language just isn’t a priority for me right now. That is, maybe sometimes procrastination is prioritisation in disguise.\n Procrastination vs. Prioritisation\nIt’s all too easy to beat ourselves up for not learning a new language, for not starting a blog or Youtube channel, for not quitting the job and finding a new job. The culture of comparison created by social media encourages us to think that we are less because we’re doing less. But this isn’t always true.\nWe need to be honest with ourselves about whether we can actually make the time to do the thing we want to do. If we can’t or choose not to make the time to pursue the project or task, that’s okay too —we’re not procrastinating, we’re just prioritising. It might be the case that in this current season of our life, we’re choosing to prioritise other things, and maybe later we’ll get around to prioritising this new project.\n The Energy Ledger\nIt can be hard to figure out what we should prioritise and to figure out whether we do in fact have the time to make progress on the projects that matter to us.\nHere’s a simple tool that I use to figure out where I should be directing my energy. I call it the Energy Ledger.\nStep 1. Go through your week and estimate how much time you’re spending on each activity. You can do this for your work, or your personal life, or both.\nStep 2. Put each activity into one of the following four quadrants.\n\n\n\nHere’s what mine looks like\n\n\n\nThe activities in the top left quadrant (things that you have to do and which boosts your energy) are the ones that we should be aiming to integrate into our lives.\nThe activities in the bottom right quadrant (things you don’t have to do, and which drain your energy) are the ones we should be aiming to eliminate from our lives. For me, scrolling social media, and watching YouTube videos on my phone in bed, are activities that I spend an inordinate amount of time doing, but that drains my energy rather than replenishes it.\nQuestion of the week\nI would love it if you guys could try out the Energy Ledger and let me know what you discover. Are there things that you are prioritising but shouldn’t be prioritising? Are there things that you aren’t prioritising but should be prioritising?\nIf you’re up for creating an energy ledge, please use this link here. As usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey last week about hard stops. Shoutout to Cissy who shared this article by Saundra Dalton-Smith MD about the different types of rest that we need. Saundra talks about 7 different kinds of rest, including things like physical rest, mental rest, and creative rest (yup, it’s a thing). Saundra also says that sleep is not the same as rest, even though lots of us confuse the two. An eye-opening read!\nThat’s it from me this week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nI had a thought in the shower the other day while singing at the top of lungs to my favourite Hamilton song. Why is it so much easier for most of us to sing in the shower than in public? And why is this so even for my friends who are good at singing?\nThere’s something about doing things in front of others that triggers a warning signal in our brains: potential (negative) judgments from people. This fear of judgment makes us clam up and makes our vocal cords constrict. In the privacy of our showers, this fear of judgment goes away, we relax, and sing freely.\nSimple realisation. Big implications.\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, I thought about how fear of judgment holds us back from doing what we want to or need to do. A common misperception is that we struggle to be productive because we’re lazy or because the task is too difficult.\nBut a lot of the times, what holds us back from getting something done isn’t how difficult that task is but our fear about what other people will think about how we perform. This is pretty common among people who want to start YouTube channels. Usually, it’s not the difficulty of putting a video together that’s holding us back, but the fear of what other people would think if you publish a cringey video.\nBut here’s the thing: 99% of the time, nobody cares.\n The No-One-Cares Mindset\nI’ve been thinking about a strategy called the NO-ONE-CARES MINDSET (the NOC mindset). It’s a strategy that I (subconsciously) used quite a lot back in the early days of putting myself out on the world wide web. Here’s how it goes:\n(1) When you’re struggling to get something done, ask yourself what’s stopping you. Is it because the task is too hard? Or is it because you’re worried about what other people would think?\n(2) If it’s fear of judgment holding you back, remind yourself that NO ONE CARES and then ask yourself What’s the worst that will happen if I did X? Can I survive if that worst thing happened?\nHere are some examples:\n\nNo One Cares if my first few YouTube videos are terrible and cringey. The worst that will probably happen is that I don’t make a good impression and struggle to grow the YouTube channel, which is totally okay.\nNo One Cares if I write blog posts that are a bit rambly because I haven’t had much experience of writing. The worst that will probably happen is that my Mum is my only reader, which I can deal with.\nNo One Cares if the first 3 businesses I start never make any money. The worst that will probably happen is that I go broke or need to stick to a traditional day job, which I will make the best of.\n\nQuestion of the week\nI’d love it for you guys to give the NOC mindset a go and report your findings. Has fear of judgment stopped you from doing something that you want to or need to do? Has applying the NOC mindset helped you? If you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on The Energy Ledger last week. If you missed the Energy Ledger exercise last week and fancy having a go, check out this link here.\nWe collected all your responses and found that these are the TOP 3 activities that we found for each box:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy takeaways?\n\nLearning, creating, and building relationships is an energy booster for most of us\nSocial media seems to be an energy drainer for most of us…\n\nThat’s it from me this week!\nAli xx"

This is a week where business-as-usual is put on pause and people fly off for their summer holidays and/or to work on their personal projects.\nWith the office quietening down and with a little more time on my hands, I’ve been thinking about how to structure my work week…\n The Energy Investment Portfolio\nI’ve been using a tool called The Energy Investment Portfolio (EIP) to figure out the key things I want to focus on this week.

The EIP is basically a glorified to-do list to keep track of the projects that you’re currently working on. It helps me keep tabs of what projects I’m choosing to invest energy into and hopefully get energy out of.\nHere’s how the simplified version works: Make 2 lists\n\nList A is a list of your dream investments. This is a list of your dreams, hopes, ambitions. These are things you would like to do at some point, just probably not right now.\nList B is a list of your active investments. These are the projects you’re actively investing (or want to be actively investing) energy into right now. And by right now, I mean this week.\n\n Dunbar Number of Active Investments\nAfter quite a bit of trial and error, I learned that there’s a key to making the EIP work well: limit the number of projects on your list of active investments.\nWe all like the idea of having lots of active investments – it makes us feel ambitious and productive. But the reality is that if we have too many projects on the active investment list, our attention and energy is divided across too many projects and we fail to do any one of them well.\nThis is related to an idea called Dunbar’s number. Dunbar’s number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people that you can maintain a stable social relationship with. These are relationships where you know each person and you know how each person relates to every other person. In the 1990s, British anthropologist Robin Dunbar suggested that this number is 150. This means that out of the 4000 connections you have on social media (Facebook friends, Instagram followers, etc), you can realistically have stable relationships with 150 of those people.\nLet’s come back to the EIP. For the EIP to work well, it’s important for us to find our Dunbar number of active investments. Ask yourself: What’s the optimal number of active investment for you so that you can invest energy into all those projects?\nI personally like to limit mine to around five. This week I’ve chosen to go even lower. Here’s what my active investments look like for this week\n\nRedraft Parts II and III of the book\nBrainstorm and plan Youtube videos for the coming month\nCreate dream list of people whom I’d like to interview on my podcast next season\n\nQuestion of the week\nIf you’re up for trying out the Energy Investment Portfolio, please have a go here. I’d love to get any thoughts you might have on your Dunbar number of active investments, as well as what’s on your list of active investments for this week.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on the No-one cares mindset last week where we asked you whether fear of judgment is holding you back from doing what you want.\nWe loved your responses! Shoutout to Narayani for sharing your story about how the NOC mindset helped you overcome stage fright.\nI had stage fear 2 years ago. I would tremble and shiver and would go weak in the knees at the thought of public scrutiny. Later I realized that I was missing out on public events that looked appealing to me. So I thought to myself that the worst that could happen was that nobody would understand what I was saying and wouldn’t clap. Then? Nothing would happen. My mum would be there to support me and that’s what matters 2 years later, I’ve performed and hosted several events without caring what people will think of me and I’ve been grateful so far!\nThat’s it from me this week!\nAli xx"

    "article_body": "When writing these blog posts, I often run into writer’s block. Confronted with a blank canvas on whatever writing app I’m trying that week, I sit like a lemon and sometimes stare at the screen for hours before anything gets done.\nBut recently I came across a concept that’s changed the way I write. I came across it in an episode of the Tim Ferriss Show where he’s interviewing Safi Bahcall, a physicist-and-writer. Safi talks about how there are 3 modes of writing – hunting, drafting and editing. In the drafting stage, where we want to be chucking our ideas down on paper as fast as possible, it’s easy to get caught up in perfectionism and therefore not get anything done.\nThe solution is to write FBR. FBR stands for Fast, Bad, Wrong.\nWrite fast, write bad, and write wrong. Terrible style, terrible grammar, terrible word choice, wrong facts, and that liberates you. That liberates you to follow the narrative thread and just keep going and going with it. And don’t stop and backtrack, because every time you stop, it’s like a car going down the highway – it’s easy to stop, but then you have to spend all this fuel to get back up to speed, and you might not get there. You discover that start writing, and start pulling on that narrative thread, it’s really surprising where it goes. But only if you go fast. Not if you go slow.\nSince coming across this acronym, I’ve found it much easier to write these posts and even to plan videos. I just tell myself ‘write FBR’ and that gives me permission to write from the heart, to say whatever pops into my head without any regard for whether it’s ‘good’ or not. Then, at a later date, I edit the first draft, and even if I thought it was pretty crap the first time around, I find that when I read it with a fresh set of eyes, it’s not as bad as I thought.\nI think the FBR approach works great for any type of creative endeavour. Often we want to separate the first draft from the later editing stages, but our perfectionist tendencies prevent us from making headway. Even for stuff like starting a YouTube channel, or starting a blog – if we tell ourselves that our first 50 videos or articles are going to be FBR, it makes it infinitely easier to get started."

    "article_body": "Accountability is a powerful thing. Making a commitment to doing something and then holding ourselves accountable to others is one of the most useful tools in our motivation and productivity arsenals.\nWithout accountability, there’s absolutely no way I would’ve written these mini blog posts for the past 70 weeks. And without accountability there’s certainly no way I would be up at 1am (having just driven 2 hours to get home from a friends wedding, with work early the following morning and wanting nothing better than to sink into my bed and sleep) to write this blog post.\nAccountability is also a core component of the online writing course that I enrolled in this week. It’s an 8-week programme that teaches students how to write and publish valuable content on the internet. There are 2 forms of accountability in the course. Firstly, it requires students to create their own weekly email newsletters to share our writing to. And secondly it brings students together in small groups to critique each other’s work. The course instructor David recognises that even though the cohort of students are paying a lot of money to take part, and are probably very motivated to improve our writing, we still need these accountability ‘hacks’ to force us to actually take action.\nSo if you’re trying to do anything that benefits from consistency (as most things do) and you’re struggling with finding the motivation to keep going, consider hacking your environment to increase your accountability. You could easily do that by tweeting updates, or starting your own free blog to tell your mum about what you’re working on. It doesn’t matter how small-scale the accountability is – as long as it’s there it’ll work for you.\nJust like it’s worked for me today when I really couldn’t be bothered to write this post, but now it’s done and I can finally sleep"

This is going to be fun \n\n Book Update\nI’ve got the publishing deal with Penguin Random House (UK). We’re working on finalising the book proposal to send the US publishers as well to try and get a US + International deal at the same time.\nThis proposal thing is proving to be harder than I thought, because you have to write a Chapter Summary for each chapter of the book, and that sort-of requires knowing what’s going to be in each chapter. Or at least, pretending that you do.\nWe (my editor and I) have a pretty good idea of the direction we’re taking with the book overall, but because we want it to be scientifically grounded, there’s a huge research element, which I’ll be working through over the next few weeks to months.\n Shoutouts\n\nThank you to Paul Millerd for chatting to me for an hour about the relationship between meaning and productivity, and how he goes about coaching people to figure out what they find meaningful / their values. If you’re interested in this stuff, follow him on Twitter and check out his newsletter.\nThank you to Neel Nanda for a 1h conversation about similar stuff. Neel featured in a recent episode of my podcast, and his blog is an amazing source of inspiration for anyone interested in living a more meaningful life.\nThank you to David Perell for a cheeky Facetime where we discussed the general framing of the book + he offered some good ideas about productivity. David’s thought a lot about these topics in his extensive writing.\n\n Help Me Please\n\nI’m trying to find case studies / scientific studies that relate productivity with meaning. Do you know of any off the top of your head? If so, I’d love for you to hit &lt;reply&gt; and share your thoughts.\nApparently US publishers are often wary of publishing UK authors. Do you know any big name people / writers who might be able to help ‘endorse’ the book proposal to increase our chances of getting a US deal? If you could email do an email intro I’d be forever grateful.\n\n Next Steps\nI’ve realised that I need to carve out time in my calendar to focus on the book, and to have accountablity during that time.\nAnd so, every weekday at 10am GMT for the next 4 weeks, I’ll be doing a live streamed coworking session that you’re very welcome to join.\nIt’ll be a zoom call with webcams on, microphones muted. I’ll play some instrumental focus music, and we’ll all do 2 pomodoros worth of writing / other high-leverage work.\nClick HERE to register for the Zoom events.\n——\nThanks for joining the journey. I’ll send another email in a couple of weeks to keep you updated. In the meantime, if you’ve got any of your own ideas about meaningful productivity (especially if you can point me in the direction of case studies / scientific studies about the topic), please do hit &lt;reply&gt; and let me know \nHave a great week!\nAli"

    "article_body": "I’ve had a few messages from students who were disappointed by their exam results and wanted some of my wannabe-life-guru advice on how to deal with the sadness they were feeling. Let’s tackle the symptom first, and then the disease.\nThe symptom – Feeling bad about results\nWhenever I’m feeling bad about anything, I go through the following thought process – Firstly, I work out whether there’s anything I can do to remedy the situation and/or learn from it. Then having done that, I ask whether continuing to feel bad about it will have any further benefit. If not (as in the vast majority of cases), I simply choose not to feel bad about it anymore.\nSo in the case of exam results, the disappointment that comes from getting (in our view) ‘bad’ results is useful insofar as it encourages us to work harder next time (if that’s even what we really want). Beyond that however, continuing to feel bad about our results (which are now completely outside our control) is a bit pointless, so we can choose not to feel that way.\nIf we’re not used to thinking in this way, this idea that we can choose our thoughts/emotions might seem ridiculous. But it really does work – to find out more, you might like to look into stoicism (a school of philosophy that’s seen a resurgence in recent years). My favourite book on the subject is (as lots of you know) Happy by Derren Brown.\nA Guide To The Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy by William Irvine is also a very good introduction to the topic.\nIf you check those books out, you’ll be armed with some tools for dealing with negative emotions that you’ll use for the rest of your life. Or, at the very least, you’ll be reading something interesting instead of wallowing in disappointment \nThe disease – Identity crisis\nThe reason most of us feel disappointed about bad exam results is that our sense of identity is tied up in our exam performance to some degree.\nIf our grades make up too much (or in some cases, all) of our identity and then we perform poorly, we’re naturally going to be devastated.\nThe solution is to diversify our identity. I was going to write something profound about this, but then I googled diversify identity and came across this Mark Manson article about exactly that, written in such a nice way that there’s no point me rephrasing it. On that note, Mark Manson is one of my favourite writers and his blog is one I follow semi-religiously.\nWhen you have money, it’s always smart to diversify your investments. That way if one of them goes south, you don’t lose everything. It’s also smart to diversify your identity, to invest your self-esteem and what you care about into a variety of different areas — business, social life, relationships, philanthropy, athletics — so that when one goes south, you’re not completely screwed over and emotionally wrecked.\nLet’s leave it there for now. If you’re disappointed by your exam results, firstly it’s okay – we’ve all been there  Secondly, remind yourself of the Serenity Prayer (below) and look into some stoic methods for dealing with negative emotions. And thirdly, consider that your identity might be too wrapped up in your grades, and think about how you might diversify it.\nGod grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can;and wisdom to know the difference.\nFurther Reading\n\nhttps://markmanson.net/diversify-your-identity\nhttps://dailystoic.com/what-is-stoicism-a-definition-3-stoic-exercises-to-get-you-started/\n\nThis post originally appeared as part of my weekly email newsletter. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

    "category": "Studying",
    "link": [
      "https://aliabdaal.com/revision-techniques/"
    ],
    "article_body": "Revision is personal. How we revise, the techniques we use and the time we spend trying to revise will vary but we do all drift towards techniques that feel intuitively productive. We’re never sure what is the optimal technique but research has shown that by far the most popular strategies revolve around rereading, highlighting and summarising.\nHowever, studies have shown that these techniques don’t consistently boost our performance. This paper from 2013 by Professor Dunlosky, analysed hundreds of studies relating to revision technique and showed that these three popular techniques had ‘low utility’ when compared to other approaches. This post explores why.\n1. Rereading\nRereading is the most popular technique that students rely upon to revise. It’s straightforward and gives the impression that we’re engaging in productive work.\nHowever, research suggests that it isn’t a productive nor efficient form of studying. Rereading is generally passive – the brain is most effective at retaining information when it is being actively used.\nDunlosky and his colleagues concluded that rereading notes or textbooks has ‘low utility’. Whilst it can improve some very short-term retention, in comparison to other techniques that you could be doing, it is far from ideal.\nWhen compared with some other learning techniques, rereading is typically much less effective…The relative disadvantage of rereading to other techniques is the largest strike against rereading and is the factor that weighed most heavily in our decision to assign it a rating of low utility.\nIn essence, despite the vast majority of us relying on rereading as a technique to enhance our revision, it is ineffective, inefficient and has ‘low utility’ when compared with other techniques.\n2. Highlighting\nThe second popular technique is highlighting. Once again, evidence suggests that highlighting is a particularly popular revision strategy – it’s active, feels productive and even allows our creative tendencies to (over)flow into making our notes look colourful!\nHowever, if we go back to the meta-study conducted by Professor Dunlosky and his colleagues, they rated highlighting as having low utility too – simply providing what Dunlosky called a safety blanket.\nIn most situations…highlighting does little to boost performance. It may actually hurt performance on higher-level tasks that require inference making.\n \nThis second point about inference is especially important. Many subjects  at A-Level and university require some degree of making inferences. As such, highlighting could be hindering our performance when tasked with making such inferences.\n3. Summarising / Making Notes\nSummarising and making notes has great appeal too as a means of making our revision feel more productive. Whilst evidence is more equivocal in this case and the quality of notes varies between students, Professor Dunlosky and his colleagues concluded that:\nOn the basis of the available evidence, we rate summarization as low utility. It can be an effective learning strategy for learners who are already skilled at summarizing; however, many learners (including children, high school students, and even some undergraduates) will require extensive training, which makes this strategy less feasible.\nIn essence, if you know how to effectively summarise and make notes it can be useful but we’re rarely, if ever, taught or trained to make notes effectively. Even if you’re particularly adept at note-taking, the technique still falls around the middle of the pack compared to other revision techniques.\nConsequently, the conclusion we should draw from this is that: Making notes is far less effective than we perhaps convince ourselves that it can be.\nThis isn’t to say that making notes is a complete waste of time – it can sometimes make revision enjoyable if you like using colours or calligraphy. But we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that it’s one of the more effective revision techniques – just because we’re writing things down, doesn’t mean we’re making the best use of our revision time!\n\nRereading, highlighting and summarising may be popular strategies that we’ve probably all relied upon at some stage during our studies. However, their popularity does not correlate with how effective they are. I will explore the revision techniques that we could be utilising to make our studying more effective and efficient in future blog posts in this ‘How To Study’ series.\n\nThis article references the first half of this video which looks at these 3 popular but ineffective revision tips. The second half of the video, which looks at active recall, will be addressed in the next ‘How To Study’ blog post."

It doesn’t matter if it sucks, because you can always edit it later, but you need to write something. Want to start a blog? Great, start writing your first post in Notepad and figure out the logistics of setting up the website later.\nIf you’ve studied chemistry, you’ll know about activation energy – the ‘hump’ of energy required to get a reaction started. It’s the same in real life – if we want to get anything done, we need to put in a burst of activation energy to begin with, and things become a lot easier.\nThis is one of the best ‘productivity hacks’ that I’ve ever come across – the idea that to overcome activation energy, you can force yourself to start. Everything takes care of itself after that.\nI often find myself needing this advice when writing these emails/blog posts. There are some weeks when I spend an hour trying to work out what to write about, and then another hour working out the first paragraph. That’s a pretty unsustainable way of doing this. This week however, I just started typing whatever came to mind, and then edited it a bit afterwards. That reduced the amount of time it takes to write the email from 2+ hours to around 15 minutes – much more manageable over the long term.\nAs someone famous once said, the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

    ],
    "article_body": "If rereading, highlighting and summarising aren’t effective methods of revising, then what should we be doing? The two most effective methods that I’ve come across are active recall and spaced repetition which, in combination, will help make your studies more efficient, effective and rewarding. I’ll cover spaced repetition in a future post but for now I’ll concentrate on active recall.\nActive Recall Theory and Evidence\nWe often think that learning is a process whereby you test yourself after having learnt all the information. Surely it’s counterintuitive to do anything else? In fact, this can’t be further from the truth!\nActive recall involves retrieving information from memory through, essentially, testing yourself at every stage of the revision process. The very act of retrieving information and data from our brains not only strengthens our ability to retain information but also improves connections in our brains between different concepts.\nResearch from 2013 which analysed hundreds of separate studies about effective revision techniques, concluded that testing, or active recall, is a technique that has ‘high utility’ and can be implemented effectively with minimal training.\nOn the basis of the evidence…we rate practice testing as having high utility. Testing effects have been demonstrated across an impressive range of practice-test formats, kinds of material, learner ages, outcome measures, and retention intervals. Thus, practice testing has broad applicability.\nThese studies from 1939 and 2010 provide valuable verification of the effectiveness of active recall but it was a study from 2011 that I found particularly convincing.\nIn that study, the researchers split students into 4 groups with each student tasked with learning the same material before being tested on what they learnt. However, each group was given different instructions and parameters for learning the content.\n– The first group would read the material only once.\n– The second group would read the material four times.\n– The third group would read the material then were told to make a mind map.\n– The fourth group would read the material once, then recall as much as possible.\nIn both the verbatim test – when asked to recall facts – as well as the inference test – when asked to recall concepts – the active recall group significantly outperformed the other groups.\nThis study shows that testing yourself just once is more effective than rereading a chapter four times. I’m sure we’ve all used rereading at some point but simply through testing yourself once you could drastically improve the efficacy and efficiency of your studies. This is such a simple technique but has such substantial, obvious benefits that we would be foolish to not use it!\nPerhaps the reason we don’t like to use active recall is that it’s more difficult and mentally taxing than rereading. But the key point is revision should be cognitively demanding! It’s useful to think about this in terms of going to the gym – if you’re lifting weights that are light, you’re not going to make much progress but if you’re lifting weights that test your strength, you’re more likely to develop muscle faster. It’s the same with developing the ‘muscle’ of your brain – the harder we have to work to retrieve information, the more effective our brains will become in storing and recalling that information in the future.\nActive Recall Strategies\nSo, how can we apply active recall in our own studies? Are there any strategies that are more effective? Well, first of all, almost anything we do that requires us to use cognitive effort and brain power to retrieve information is going to be helpful. However, more specifically, I used a number of strategies which utilised active recall and below are three approaches that, personally, I’ve found useful.\nClosed Book\nIf you can’t quite break the habit of making notes, one strategy I found particularly helpful was making notes with your book closed. Instead of copying directly out of the textbook, try to learn a topic before writing out how you would explain the key points and key concepts in your own words but with the book closed. Once you’ve written down as much as you can remember, open the book and add the parts you missed.\nThis may sound simplistic and, in many respects, it is! However, it was particularly effective when I was preparing for my third year exams in psychology when I’d made essay plans and, in order to commit them to memory, I decided to draw spider diagrams of each plan with my book closed. I’d draw out as much as I could from memory and afterwards go back to my actual plan and fill in any information that was missing.\nI repeated this for about two months in the lead up to the exams – combining active recall with spaced repetition – and by the time the exams came round I had a good grasp of over 50 essays, each with references, which I could then draw upon in the exam.\nSo it’s a simple strategy but if it can work for third year university exams, I’m sure you can find a way of making it work for your personal needs too.\n\nAlternative to Making Notes…Ask Questions\nDespite evidence showing that note-taking isn’t an effective revision technique, it still feels intuitively productive to write things down, right? I didn’t want to completely stop making notes so I tried to adapt this desire to make notes and began to write questions for myself.\nThis strategy resembles the ‘Cornell Note-Taking’ method – the process of writing questions for yourself based upon the material in the syllabus. This produces a list of questions with the main idea being that instead of passively rereading or highlighting the information as we’re often tempted to do, we’re forced to actively engage in cognitive effort to retrieve the information to answer the questions which strengthens connections between information in our brains and improves our ability to recall that information in an exam.\nIn essence, writing questions forces you to engage in cognitive effort and the more brain power it takes to recall a fact, the more mentally taxing your studies are and the more you’re going to gain from the time you put into revision.\nAnki\nAnki is a flashcard app that allows you to create online flashcards which you can use to test yourself in practice sessions. It uses an algorithm built around active recall and spaced repetition and hence learns as you progress through your studies and revision.\nI found Anki particularly useful for two key reasons:\n\nFirstly, memorising particular facts – for example, as a medical student I used it a lot for pharmacology – learning the names of drugs and what they do.\nSecondly, I also used it to help memorise particular paragraphs that I could slot into appropriate essays.\n\nCheck out the video for how I specifically did this but I certainly found it incredibly helpful! In fact, one of my friends from university who consistently ranked at the top of our year in terms of exam results found Anki so useful that he switched from making notes in lectures to going straight to making flashcards with the app! If that isn’t a positive endorsement of how useful it can be, I don’t know what is!\nAnd if you’d like to read more of my Studying articles, head to this page here which includes pieces on The Essay Memorisation Framework and The Power of Retrospective Revision Timetables."

    "article_body": "Revision timetables are often praised as the best way to structure your time in a coherent, logical manner. It’s certainly true that they can have some benefits and I know that revision timetables can work for some people – that’s absolutely fine.\nBut are we using them in the correct way? Is the standard ‘prospective’ timetable really the most effective technique? I don’t believe so.\nThe Standard Prospective Timetable\nProspective means looking forward — we plan out our schedule by writing our dates in advance along with the topics we want to cover. I used this method back before GCSEs, like many students still do and, as time went by, found three main problems with this approach.\n\nThis standard method requires us to look into the future and work out what topics we think we’re going to have issues with. For some, this might be crystal clear but, for most of us, it’s pretty unrealistic. Laying out topics beforehand may lead to either needlessly repeating subjects, or not covering our weakest topics enough. Also, occasionally life just gets in the way. We can’t help that. A friend’s birthday or unexpected emergencies can interrupt our entire schedule and render our neatly organised timetable useless.\nProspective timetables encourage us to think of revision as a function of time rather than topics. It doesn’t really matter how we fill our time. What matters is understanding the content. Rather than thinking each day I need to get three topics done, I find it helpful to think what topics do I need to work to improve.\nActually creating the timetable. Personally, I used to view this as an exercise in procrastination — we’re putting off studying by working on a neatly organised timetable and playing with highlighters to create a schedule that 9 times out of 10 we won’t even follow! Sounds a little absurd to me! Friends of mine even managed to put off studying for weeks by rationalising that a timetable needed to be created first. The lack of activation energy engaged them in a damaging cycle of procrastination that does nobody any good when exams are fast approaching!\n\nSo, if the common prospective timetable is unhelpful, what should we be doing? Enter retrospective timetabling.\nThe Retrospective Timetable\nRetrospective revision timetables reverse the conventional method. Rather than starting with a timeline of dates, we start with a list of subjects and topics that we have compiled through scoping our subject.\nThis method of scoping your course is, in itself, a very valuable use of time. A subject can often seem daunting until it’s broken down into its constituent parts.\nMy Spaced Repetition Spreadsheet System, which you can read about here, is an example of a retrospective timetable in action. The approach involves making a sheet for each subject and, in the first column of each spreadsheet, you list all the topics for that subject.\nOnce you’ve done this, the spreadsheet system is very simple. In essence, every time you study a topic and, crucially, test yourself through actively recall, then you write the current date in the column corresponding to that topic in the spreadsheet.\nAfter repeating this exercise, you build up a list of repetitions as well as a table which enables you to keep track of not only when you last studied that topic but, by colour coding each topic based on your comprehension, you can start to rank how confident you are for each area of the course.\nAli’s Spreadsheet System for Third Year Psychology\nBy inputting dates into my spreadsheet as well as colour coding my understanding, each morning I can look through my lists, identify which topics have a red mark by them and/or haven’t been covered for a few days, and then work on those topics for that day.\nOver time, we develop a deeper understanding of all of our topics and, by working on our weakest areas each day we’re tackling the content that we find most difficult which is therefore more cognitively demanding and hence more effective at improving our long-term memory.\nBut you may be wondering how should you approach your spreadsheet? The first thing to do is start with what you DON’T know.\nWe often gravitate towards topics that we feel comfortable studying because we know the basic principles and it feels easier. But for your revision to be effective, you have to keep reminding yourself to study topics that you are least comfortable with.\nFor example, I started with the final topic in the textbook and then worked my way back. By starting at the end of the textbook or even at a random point in the course, it encourages you to study topics that are more cognitively demanding. That said, you may find the first few topics particularly difficult and so it would be better for you to concentrate on those.\nThe KEY POINT is to avoid starting with topics that you already feel that you have a good grasp of – whilst it may feel satisfying, it’s not mentally taxing and, as I’ve said elsewhere, learning is most effective when we’re engaging in cognitively demanding study.\nThe more effort it takes you to learn a topic and the more effort it takes you to actively recall information – the stronger that information is going to get encoded in your long-term memory.\nPersonally, I also found that it was better for me to blitz through a topic, test myself and repeat this process for 10 different areas on a single day rather than spend hours focussed on a single topic.\nIt’s easy to get too focussed on one topic and fall into the trap of Parkinson’s Law whereby work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.\nAn approach which aims to target multiple areas on the same day can help to prevent you from getting caught up in one complex area.\nIn fact, this approach where you switch tasks and subjects regularly rather than ‘blocking’ numerous hours/days trying to learn a single topic is a form of ‘interleaving’.\nIt might appear somewhat counterintuitive and it’s hard to convince yourself to take this approach, but there has been evidence in both sport and academia which shows that it’s more efficient and effective as, over time, it constructs a stronger knowledge base.\nIt certainly worked for me – please give it a try for a few days at least and I’d be surprised if you didn’t see some benefits!\n\nTo summarise, the main reasons why I prefer a retrospective approach to timetable over the classic prospective timetables are:\n\nWe don’t have to look into the future.\nWe can see an overview of our topics as well as our confidence with each topic.\nIt encourages us to think of our studying in terms of topics, instead of time.\nIt’s easy to construct one of these spreadsheets that it spares us the cognitive effort of having to look weeks into the future.\nIt accounts for unpredictable events that could offset our entire calendar.\n\nI understand that everyone is different and timetables do work for some people but if you’re finding that your standard ‘prospective’ timetable doesn’t really work then perhaps try the retrospective spreadsheet system.\nGive it a go and let me know how it works out for you.\n\nVideos relevant to this blog post:\n\n(^ Particularly Parts 3 and 4)"

    "article_body": "The amount of time we spend revising is always a controversial issue – some people prefer to downplay how much time they’ve spent revising whereas others are keen to tell you how much revision they’ve done. The fact is we’re all different in how much time we spend studying but if active recall is an effective technique, the next question I want to address is how we should be using it to enhance our performance. This is where spaced repetition comes in.\nSpaced Repetition vs Cramming – The Theory and Evidence\nAs the name suggests, spaced repetition involves spacing your revision and reviewing topics, ideally by active recall, at specific intervals over a period of time.\nIt can be explained by the ‘forgetting curve’ – an idea that has been around in the psychology literature for over one hundred years. The forgetting curve is the idea that over time we forget things at an exponential rate – akin to the half-life of radioactive substances if you want a scientific analogy!\nThe way we can take advantage of the forgetting curve is through breaking the cycle by reviewing material at spaced intervals. This might be obvious to you but its importance cannot be overstated. The more that we practice and the more spaced this repetition becomes, the more likely we are to encode this information into our long-term memory.\nIn essence, the idea behind spaced repetition is that you allow your brain to forget some of the information to ensure that the active recall process is mentally taxing. The psychology literature suggests that the harder that your brain has to work to retrieve information, the more likely that that information will be encoded.\n\nBy spacing our repetition by a day, 3 days, then a week, we allow ourselves to forget some of the information such that when we revise the topic – through active recall – it takes active brain power. Rereading, on the other hand, has low utility because it is a passive exercise – just testing yourself once has been shown to be more effective than rereading the same passage four times.\nWhat’s even more astounding is that evidence suggests that, even within the same study session, spaced repetition can be a more efficient technique in terms of retaining information. A 2011 study involving four groups of students who were tasked with trying to learn words in Swahili found that recalling information even within the same session had dramatic benefits. In the study, one group only studied the words once and this didn’t produce impressive results. The second group saw each word once and then had to recall a word once before being tested and, as you can see from the graph, just through recalling a word once, your performance increases. The third group had to recall the same words multiple times which produced similar results to Group 2.\nHowever, most interestingly, the final group saw each word, recalled it, then had a gap of a few more words before recalling the first word again. In effect, this final group spaced their recall and, as the graph illustrates, the results are astonishing.\nThe students were doing exactly the same work – the only difference being that their recall was spaced out compared to groups 2 and 3. This study not only emphasises the power of active recall but also provides firm evidence of the power of spaced repetition and how we only need to restructure our revision slightly to obtain a substantial improvement in our ability to remember and recall information.\nThis active recall-spaced repetition combination can easily be adapted into our studying. For instance, let’s say you studied Topic 1 and Topic 2 one morning and planned to move to Topic 3 and Topic 4 in the afternoon. The results from this study demonstrate that you should go back to Topic 1 and write down – through active recall – what you can remember before moving onto Topic 3. You would then repeat this for Topic 2 after having studied Topic 3 and so forth.\nIn essence, spaced repetition over days and weeks as well as reviewing content on the same day, can both be extremely helpful for improving exam performance.\nApplying Spaced Repetition\nIn practical terms, applying active recall and spaced repetition could be as simple as taking a pen and paper at the end of the day and answering your active recall questions, or constructing a spider diagram of what you’ve learnt – all with your book closed obviously!\nBut I know that different techniques work better for some people compared to others. The following strategies are the ones that worked effectively for me – if you’re struggling with your studying, then perhaps give these a try.\nMy ‘Magic’ Spaced Repetition Spreadsheet System\nAs you may have seen in past videos, one of the key techniques that I’ve found particularly effective is a spreadsheet system that I adapted using Google Sheets. (NB: I preferred using Google Sheets specifically as it gives you access across devices and allows you to update your spreadsheet wherever you are – removing unnecessary friction of having to rely on having the latest Excel software to open certain files!).\nThe approach involves making a sheet for each subject and then in the first column of each spreadsheet, you list all the topics for that subject. To do this, it is essential to ‘scope’ your subject. This might sound simple and obvious but in offering advice to students over recent years, it’s been quite astounding how few students know their course inside out or know exactly what topics they have in their subject. So, even if it takes a whole day to compile using your syllabus and/or past exam papers, scoping your subject is essential in order to produce a list of all the topics that you need which will make revision far more straightforward.\nOnce you’ve done this, the actual spreadsheet system is very simple but, as I’ve found, extremely effective. In essence, every time you study a topic and, critically, actively recall information from that topic, then you write the current date in the column along in the spreadsheet. Marking a date is not just when you have read a chapter in the textbook – that is too passive – you can only mark a date when you have actively recalled information, facts, quotes or essay plans. After having studied other topics and repeated this exercise, you build up a list of repetitions as well as a table which enables you to keep track not only of when you last studied that topic but, by colour coding each topic based on your comprehension, you can also start to rank how confident you are on each particular topic.\nBelow is an example of a spreadsheet that I used in my Third Year when I was doing psychology. Once I had actively recalled the essay plan by drawing a spider diagram for each one, I would write the date in the corresponding box in the spreadsheet. I then colour coded each box based on how accurate my recall was which gave me a very visual representation of the areas in which I was stronger and/or weaker.\n\n\nSummary / Extra Notes\n\nActive recall and spaced repetition provide a brilliant blend that can improve the efficiency and efficacy of your studies.\nSpaced repetition is better than cramming – even within a single study session.\nThe spreadsheet system is very simple, gives a pictorial representation of where you are for each of your subjects and allows you to more effectively plot your daily timetables.\n\nAnd if you found this helpful…\nI think you’d also like my Studying page. It breaks down a few more methods including Active Recall – which I’d highly recommend checking out."

    "category": "Studying",

    ],
    "article_body": "The Pomodoro Technique is perhaps the simplest productivity and time-management strategy which we can all use – you don’t need any technical apps or sophisticated technology; all you need is a timer!\nThe technique was ‘invented’ in the early 1990s by developer, entrepreneur, and author Francesco Cirillo.\nCirillo noticed that when faced with large tasks or a series of assignments, we’re able to be most effective if we break the work down into short, timed intervals (called Pomodoros) which are spaced out by short breaks.\nInteresting Side Note: Cirillo named the system Pomodoro after the tomato-shaped timer he used to track his work as a university student.\n\nIn essence, it is a cyclical system based around working in short bursts of 25 minutes with intermittent breaks, of 5 minutes, which can help to improve motivation, creativity and efficiency.\nTheory\nThis theory has been supported by scientific literature too. Research has shown that taking regular breaks can vastly improve focus and concentration for prolonged periods.\nThis study, for instance, from researchers at the University of Illinois, upends the intuitive theory about the nature of attention by demonstrating that short breaks from a task can dramatically improve one’s ability to focus for prolonged periods.\nThe lead researcher said that …most papers treated attention as a limited resource that would get used up over time…but you are always paying attention to something. Attention is not the problem…prolonged attention to a single task actually hinders performance.\nThe study tested participants’ ability to focus on a repetitive computerised task for an hour under various conditions. 84 participants were divided into four groups:\n\nThe control group performed the 50-minute task without breaks or diversions.\nThe switch group and the no-switch group memorised 4 digits before performing the task, and told to respond and take a break if they saw one of the digits during the task. (Only the switch group actually presented with the digits (twice) during the 50-minute experiment).\nThe digit-ignored group was shown the same digits presented to the switch group during the task, but were told to ignore them.\n\nAs anticipated, the performance of the individuals declined over the course of the task but, crucially, those in the switch group saw no drop in their performance over time. By simply having two brief breaks from their main task (to respond to the digits) they were able to stay focused during the entire experiment.\nAs a result, the researchers concluded that, when faced with long tasks, it’s best to impose brief breaks on yourself which will actually help you stay focused on your task.\nPractice\nWith that evidence in mind, the Pomodoro technique takes on even more importance. So how does the Pomodoro technique work in practice? Well, the method can broadly be described as follows:\n\nChoose a task that you’d like to get done – personally, it was writing this blog post.\nSet the timer (Pomodoro) for 25 minutes.\nWork on the task until the timer rings.\nTake a short break for 5 minutes before repeating the process again.\nEvery 4 ‘Pomodoros’ take a longer break of 15/20 minutes before starting again with the 25 minutes on / 5 minutes off cycle.\n\nThe beauty of this technique is its’ simplicity. All you need is a timer. If you have a mobile device there are plenty of apps with the Pomodoro system built in – I personally use Focus which I think is only an iOS app but there are plenty for Android as well!\nThe evidence suggests that it can improve results and performance but there are other advantages too. For instance, it can help to manage distractions and thus improve focus, concentration and, hence, productivity and efficiency.\nIt can also help to break down larger tasks into manageable periods of time enabling you to feel less daunted by the size of one large assignment – breaking it down can help you to manage expectations and more accurately keep track of how long you have spent on the task.\nHaving said all this, some people find the timer too much of a rigid structure. Also, as with other strategies, sometimes things can simply interrupt your studies that you have no control over – for example, perhaps you have to urgently deal with an issue at home. Pomodoro can have built-in flexibility and some apps do let you pause the timer but sometimes this can defeat the point of the exercise!\nPersonally, I think it’s important to recognise that the 20/25 minutes shouldn’t be seen as a completely rigid structure that you absolutely HAVE TO stick to – if you are focussed and feel like you need an extra 5/10 minutes to finish the work that you are doing then do that and then take a break.\nIn other words, use the Pomodoro technique but don’t ‘get used’ by the Pomodoro timer!\nThe absolutely critical thing to remember is that REGULAR BREAKS ARE CRITICAL TO YOUR PRODUCTIVITY.\n\nIf you want evidence of this in action, I used this technique to write this post! I’m sure if I hadn’t had the timer restricting me to 25 minutes of work, it would’ve taken a couple of hours to write. As it was, I was able to write this in about 1.5 Pomodoros! So, there you are, the Pomodoro technique in action!"

    "article_body": "With spring just around the corner and winter fading away, thoughts are starting to turn towards a different season – that of exams. Being able to study in a way which is both efficient, effective and successful is the dream of all students and it’s an area that I’ve researched quite widely.\nI’m sure we’ve all wondered at some point during our studies that we’ve been approaching studying wrong. Or at least not optimally. But what is optimal?\nThere are, indeed, many ways to answer this depending who you ask but, in fact, there are only a handful of principles that are backed up by rigorous evidence. One of the answers, which we’re going to talk about today, is the STIC framework for effective learning.\nSo what’s this method all about? It comprises four of the most important principles into a nice, easy mnemonic that you can apply to whatever you’re trying to learn or study. The four principles are:\n\n(S)pacing\n(T)esting\n(I)nterleaving\n(C)ategorising\n\nIf you can apply these four principles to your studying, it should become more efficient, effective and rewarding. Although the acronym works nicely as STIC, for the purposes of this article I’m going to look at Testing and Spacing first and then Categorising and Interleaving – the problem is, TSCI just isn’t quite as memorable!\nTesting\nTesting is probably the single most important factor to help boost your exam performance and results. This might not sound particularly appealing – why would we want to test ourselves even more to prepare for an exam?\nHowever, testing or ‘active recall’, which I’ve explored elsewhere, are key components of achieving efficiency with your revision and success in exams.\nIt’s hard to overstate how important testing is. All the evidence appears to show that the more you test yourself, the more likely it is that the information will stic(k) – pun intended. The theory being that every time we test ourselves, we’re forcing our brains to build connections between different areas and, in turn, the information gets encoded more strongly.\nIn the book Make it Stick by Brown, Roediger and Mcdaniel, the authors mention that students don’t perform as well as they want in their exams for the simple reason that they don’t test themselves enough. The authors also reference a study that found that testing yourself once is better than re-reading the same passage four times.\nBut how can you test yourself when you haven’t learnt all the content first? This is probably the question I get asked most frequently and whilst it makes sense intuitively, testing is actually integral to the learning process. You should even be testing yourself before you learn a topic. As David Epstein explains:\nTesting before you have had a chance to learn primes your brain for when you then hear an answer to retain it – especially if you get stuff wrong. There is something called the hypercorrection effect where if you are quite confident about an answer and it turns out you are wrong, you are more likely to remember the right one when you get it.\nSpacing\nSpacing, or spaced repetition, is the technique to literally ‘space out’ your study sessions on the same topic. Whilst studying the same thing repeatedly leads to short-term progress, it doesn’t result in sustainable recall over time.\nThis relates to a phenomenon in memory research known as The Forgetting Curve. Our brains are wired such that over time our memory deteriorates – unless you revisit that information after a period of time, re-encode it and reinforce what you’ve learnt.\nA study conducted with two groups of people who were learning Spanish vocabulary demonstrated this idea famously. The first group got 8 hours of intensive learning for one day whilst the second group were given the exact same lists but had their time split – 4 hours on one day and then another 4 hours one month later.\nWhen the participants were re-tested 8 years later, the group that had spaced practice remembered 250% more.\nWhilst you may not want to be leaving one month between study sessions if you have upcoming exams, the evidence across the literature illustrates that spacing your study sessions, and combining this with active recall testing, is far more efficient than ‘cramming’ everything at once!\nCategorising\nCategorising is one of my favourite studying techniques and one which I wish I had used throughout my studies. The theory behind this is that if we’re learning a large amount of information, it’s far more effective to build a categorisation system and a structure which helps to breakdown the material rather than simply trying to learn the information as one large unit – which is probably the default strategy.\nThere have been studies which illustrate this point whereby one group of students gets told to memorise a list of words whilst the other group have the same words but are told to categorise the words appropriately. The second group of students nearly always outperforms the first group in terms of the amount that the information sticks in the short and longer term.\nThis method is particularly effective when ‘scoping’ a subject and breaking down the information to provide a structure which you can then work from systematically.\nIt’s useful to visualise this body of knowledge as a tree, with every branch extending off into smaller branches. Each small branch holds a number of leaves (topics) and each big branch holds a number of small branches. This works well with the human brain’s natural tendency to compartmentalise and categorise information.\nIn the video that accompanies this article, I refer to how I used this method to help improve my understanding of haematology – the study of the blood – which, at the time, I found quite overwhelming.\nInterleaving\nAs opposed to the time you leave between revision sessions, interleaving is about what you do with your time WITHIN revision sessions.\nInterleaving is the idea that we should try to mix up our practice as we go along. If we get to a point where we find stuff too easy, it means we’re not learning anymore.\nIt’s quite easy when planning a revision timetable to commit certain subjects to a few solid days then move on to the next – this is known as ‘blocking’ and it comes easily to us because it’s how we’re always taught through textbooks.\nInterleaving is a process whereby you aim to mix up subjects and topics and, unlike ‘blocking’ which holds information in your short-term memory, interleaving can help to strengthen your memory associations over a longer period of time.\nWhen interleaving rather than blocking practice, different skills are intermixed rather than grouped by type – in other words, abcbcacab instead of aaabbbccc.\nThere is evidence that has shown that if you interleave different concepts together – i.e by following a question on one topic with a question on a different topic which requires a different technique to answer it – this can produce better test scores.\nIn essence, with traditional blocked practice, we don’t often need to identify the strategy because every problem can be solved in the same way with the same strategy – interleaving changes this by forcing us to consider and choose the appropriate strategy for different questions.\nConsequently, interleaving can feel more difficult. But, as we have already discussed, it is when we are finding studying difficult that our time is being spent most productively. Learning should be mentally taxing and interleaving introduces variety which produces difficulty as well as forces your brain to adapt, work with different techniques and make connections which will make your studying more effective and efficient.\nResearch into the effectiveness of interleaving in a study from 2010 found that although interleaving practice impaired practice session performance [i.e it made the actual study session more difficult] it doubled scores on a test given one day later [i.e it improved exam performance in the long term].\nAn additional benefit of interleaving is that it inadvertently ensures that practice of any particular skill is distributed, or spaced, because any two opportunities to practice the same task are not consecutive!\nIt turns out that variety is not just the spice of life but the spice of studying too!\n\nKey Points:\n\nTest yourself before, during and after studying topics.\nSpace out your revision sessions on particular topics.\nBreak down larger topics into a more structured, categorised system.\nDon’t resort to ‘blocking’ – keep your revision varied.\nAlthough we might not like to hear it, learning should be mentally taxing.\n\n\n\nIf you want more information about how you can apply testing to your studying then please see this video.\nIf you want to know more about spacing, check out this video where I go into more details about how you can apply it to your studying or this video where I discuss one of my favourite techniques – the retrospective timetable.\n\nRecommended Books:\n\nThe Sports Gene – David Epstein\nRange – David Epstein\nMake It Stick – McDaneil &amp; Brown"

    "article_body": "As a medical student, I did have to undertake some exams that required writing essays. One of the questions I often get asked is how you can apply techniques such as active recall and spaced repetition – that I frequently discuss as being ‘the best’ revision techniques – to essay-based subjects. During my third year at university, I adopted the following approach to preparing for my own essay-based psychology exams – it proved highly effective in my own exams and I hope that you can make effective use of it too.\nThe system can be broadly broken down into two stages:\n\nThe Creation Stage\n\n\nObjective to create first class essay plans for every conceivable essay title that they throw at us in the exam.\n\n2.  The Memorisation Stage\n\nObjective of committing all of these essay plans to memory by systematically using active recall, spaced repetition, spider diagrams and flashcards.\n\nThe idea is that, by using these two stages, by the time the exams arrive you’ll have memorised so many essay plans that they will either come up in the exam or the essays will be similar enough that you will have the knowledge to draw up and form coherent and well-structured essay that answer the question effectively.\n\nCreation Stage\nThere are three main questions in the creation stage:\nHow to decide what essay titles to pick/prepare\nThe objective here is to ‘scope the subject’ and find essay titles that cover the entire breadth of the syllabus. The easiest way to do this is to both look through the past papers and start by planning the essays that have come up in the past and then examine the syllabus and identify areas that lend themselves to essays. Once you’ve planned out those essays, you’ll have a better idea as to what style of questions are asked and what material is often covered. This should give you a breadth of essays titles that span the course – if you find that there is still an area of the syllabus that hasn’t been address, try to come up a suitable question and add it to your essay plans to compile.\nHow you plan the essay\nPersonally, I would give myself one day per essay plan. Although it’s best to try to have this process ongoing throughout the year, I did the bulk of my essay plan preparation in the Easter holidays (perhaps not ideal!).\nMy process involved starting off with a question then use Google to get as much information as possible about that particular topic. I would start off with Google because it can give you a good broad overview as well as useful links to review papers that would often provide key details or interesting examples.\nOnce I had created my essay plan I would then look at the lecture notes and the recommended reading. This meant that a lot of my material was more original than everyone else’s because most other people would’ve built their essays based around the lecture notes, whereas I was building my essays from a Google search supplemented by lecture notes.\nOnce I had got my research document, I would spend a few hours writing out the essay – consolidating all the information into this one essay that I am ultimately going to learn.\nHow you make sure your essay plan is really good.\nBut how do we make an essay plan good? There are 3 key ingredients in my opinions:\n\nStructure\nAnswering the question\nAdding a bit of spice.\n\nThe introduction is the most important part of the essay because you can address all three of these key ingredients and signal to the examiner how you are going to go about compiling the essay and answer the question.\nHere is an example of one of the introductions from an essay that I prepared on whether judgement and decision making is cognitive (logical) or affective (emotional).\nThe historical view in the social sciences has always been that judgements are based solely on content information, with individuals being assumed to form judgements by systematically evaluating all available content information in an unbiased manner. However, over the past three decades a considerable amount of research has challenged this assumption by showing that judgments may be formed not only on the basis of content information (cognitive judgements) but also on the basis of feelings (affective judgement). It is now well accepted that judgement can be both affective and cognitive. Whether it is one or the other depends on a multitude of factors: (1) the salience of the affective feelings, (2) the representativeness of the affective feelings for the target, (3) the relevance of the feelings for the judgement, (4) the evaluative malleability of the judgement and (5) the level of processing intensity. I will discuss these in turn and ultimately argue that generally speaking in day-to-day life, the circumstances are generally those that result in affective rather than cognitive judgements and decision making.\nAs you can see, I signpost the essay explicitly using numbered points as well as answering the question and outlining to the examiner the direction that my argument is going to go.\nThe Memorisation Stage\nBy this point, you should have a good number of essay plans that you’ve created in documents – now the aim is to ‘upload’ those essay plans to our brain. I approached doing this using three main techniques:\nAnki Flashcards\nWith my essays, I used Anki flashcards to memorise paragraphs and main points whether from an essay or key points from a particularly relevant research paper. The aim was to create blocks of content with every Anki flashcard being its’ own ‘block’ which I could then draw upon either for the essays that I had planned or for unfamiliar essays but ones which I could answer using the material from the flashcards.\nHowever, specific paragraphs or points from research papers aren’t helpful unless you can associate them with particular essays – that’s where spider diagrams come into the equation…\nSpider Diagrams\nHaving memorised content blocks from my essays using Anki flashcards, I made one page diagrams of every single essay. The idea being that you would be able to discern the structure of the essay through the spider diagram as well as notice key words that are relevant for that topic and/or that you find particularly helpful in triggering your memory about the key points that you need to raise in answering that question.\nEvery day I would draw out various spider diagrams from memory and if there were any books that I didn’t know, I would look them up in the master research document or in Anki and actively work on learning those parts.\nOver time, this became a highly effective way to systematically use active recall to ensure that I knew absolutely everything.\nRetrospective Revision Timetable\nThe final part of the system involved systematic spaced repetition. If you’ve seen any of my other content, I am a big proponent of retrospective revision timetables. This approach counters the conventional idea of planning a prospective revision timetable which has a number of issues – namely trying to predict the future and inflexibility, amongst others – and instead involves creating a spreadsheet that starts with a list of subjects, topics or essays that we have compiled through scoping our subject and then inputting the dates on which we study those areas as well as colour code the system to provide a visual representation as to which areas we might need to cover again. You can read more about these sorts of timetables here, where I explain them in more depth.\n\nThis structure which combines active recall, spaced repetition, flashcards and spider diagrams was probably the most effective system that I used whilst at university. In the exam, about two thirds of the essays that we had to write, I had already planned. Although the other four essays that I had to write were ‘new’, I had built up such a systematic and in-depth knowledge of the subject that I could more easily draw upon ‘blocks’ of content from my Anki decks which I could then ‘drop’ into these essays to answer them effectively.\nI hope this has provided you with a more logical structure with which to utilise active recall, spaced repetition, spider diagrams and flashcards to ensure that you can approach your essay-based exams with more confidence.\nPlease see the other blog posts in this ‘How To Study’ series for more hints, tips and guidance on studying and revising."

    "article_body": "The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool  Richard Feynman\n \nWhen we’re studying, it can be easy to think that we have a grasp of a subject, especially if we feel confident that we’ve learnt our notes and we feel that we can adequately answer questions. However, how often have you stopped to try and explain a concept rather than simply convinced yourself that you’ve learnt it and moved on?\nThere is a difference between knowing the name of something and understanding it – a key difference that we often overlook in our studies. I’m sure we’ve all fallen into that trap at some point. This is where the Feynman Technique can help.\nThe method is based around the idea that one of the most effective techniques to enhance your understanding of a topic is to imagine that you are teaching the material that you have learnt to someone who has absolutely no idea about the topic that you’ve just learnt – for instance a small child.\nThis method was named after Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for being able to explain complex scientific material in simplified terms and diagrams that people could understand, affording him the nickname ‘The Great Explainer’.\nRichard The Great Explainer Feynman\nSo how do you use it? There are four steps to follow:\n\nChoose a topic you have recently studied and/or a topic for which you’d like to test your knowledge and understanding.\nExplain the concept using simple language. Pretend you are teaching and explaining it to a small child or someone who has never come across the topic before. The key here is simplicity – explain the concept using simple language. Don’t simply define the concept but, if it is a mathematical concept for instance, work through examples to show how the concept works in practice.\nIdentify the areas you found particularly problematic and/or the gaps in your explanation and return to your notes, lectures, textbook until your understanding of these areas has improved. Pinpoint the parts where you had to resort to using technical terms and challenge yourself to break down those terms into simpler terminology. Ask yourself, would a small child understand what you were explaining, or would they ask ‘why does that work’ or ‘why is that the case’ or ‘what does that mean’. The key is not only to identify complex areas of your own explanations but also to challenge and identify where you have made assumptions based on what you already understand intuitively.\nReview and simplify further; ask yourself the question – could you explain this to a five-year old? If the answer is no, go back and repeat the process and your understanding so that you could.\n\n \nThe technique enables you to quickly overview a concept, identify areas that are weaker and, critically, requires active learning – you are forced to move beyond passively rereading or highlighting and actively think about how you would explain a particular concept in simple terms.\nAlthough it appears to be a simple technique, it’s highly effective. Explaining concepts in this way enables you to reconstruct the core ideas and topics in your own words which helps reinforce understanding and comprehension.\nPersonally, I found myself using a version of this technique to great effect when I became stuck with my dissertation. I was struggling to see the wood for the trees with my research and I couldn’t work out which way to take my project or an appropriate structure. During the Christmas break, I decided to cut everything back and asked my parents to act as my ‘students’ and I tried to present my findings and explain my research as simply as possible to them.\nThis was not a quick ten-minute overview, I tried to talk through everything that I had done up to that point so, in that sense, it perhaps didn’t entirely adhere to the Feynman process, but it was incredibly effective. My parents asked questions for clarification which forced me to explain concepts that I had previously taken for granted and this really helped to clarify the research in my own mind. They weren’t there to offer help or advice – I wanted to leverage the process of simply explaining my project to identify where I had made assumptions and where I could improve.\nAfter doing this, my dissertation suddenly regained its clarity and I could see a way to appropriately structure my research. From that point onwards, I actually came to enjoy writing it and it ended up being the best piece of work that I completed during my time at university.\nIf you can, leverage Feynman’s technique of explanation and add it to your armoury of revision tools which should all help to enhance understanding, increase productivity and improve performance."

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nHere’s an update on the Book Journey.\nSorry I’ve been a bit silent on here – juggling various bits of the business and writing a book has really put my productivity guru status to the test… thanks for sticking with me.\nGoing forward, I’m going to try to send an update every other week or so, with some notes on what me and our research squad worked on that week, and some lessons learned.\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we dug deep into the following topics:\n\nProcrastination: Classic, one of our absolute favourite topics. I realised that I’ve never really thought hard about what procrastination means.\nSuffering culture: There’s this belief in Western culture that work needs to be HARD for it to have value. We’re sort of allergic to having fun at work. Some of my family still ask me When are you going to get a proper job and stop making YouTube videos? I think part of the reason why doing YouTube isn’t seen as a proper job is that it seems like fun rather than work (amongst other things). So, our research question for the week was: why do we live in a culture where HARD WORK = GOOD and FUN WORK = MEH?\nBoredom: We also looked into the concept of boredom – what does it mean to be bored? Is boredom always a bad thing? Are we bad at being bored?\n\n The most interesting thing we learned\nWe found reading up on suffering culture really interesting.\nHere’s the puzzle:\n\nWe live in a world where most of us think that SUCCESS = working hard, grinning and bearing it, doing things with a David Goggins vibe.\nBut… most of us would probably be happier if we could have fun along the way and succeed.\n\nFrom my reading, here’s how we ended up in this puzzle:\n\nWe all want happiness, purpose, and meaning in life.\nBack in the 1500s, people found an answer in religion. The solution was to work hard and consume little so that you will be rewarded by God (this is where the Protestant Work Ethic idea came from).\nIn modern times, an extreme work ethic has replaced religion to create meaning in our lives. We want from work what we want from religion: belonging, meaning, purpose, community. And we think we can only get this if the work is hard. Working hard is seen as virtuous and hard workers are seen as deserving of their success.\nSo now, we define ourselves by what we are paid for and how much we work. And anyone who wants a chance of succeeding has to play this I work hard signalling game.\n\nHere’s a quote from philosopher Bertrand Russel’s 1932 essay In Praise of Idleness where he suggests we should move towards a 4-hour work day (he was clearly way ahead of his time).\nA great deal of harm is being done in the modern world by belief in the virtuousness of work, and that the road to happiness and prosperity lies in an organised diminution of work.\nQuestion of the week\nOne thing I’ve been thinking about lately is how we can enjoy our work more even if we don’t find it fun. Back in medical school, I had various tricks to make studying more fun like colour-coding my revision timetable. So, my question for you this week is:\nDo you have any examples of tips and tricks you use to make boring work more fun and enjoyable?\nI’d love to hear from you about this. If you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here. The form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey on procrastination. Here are some cool things we found from the survey\n\nA dash of fun makes hard work easier to complete – most people say that they’re more likely to procrastinate from things that are EASY but NOT FUN (2nd bar) compared to things that are HARD but FUN (3rd bar).\n\n\n\n\n\nTons of people struggle with procrastination. When asked whether ‘dealing with procrastination is something I’ve struggled with’, over 52% reported 10/10 on 0-10 scale.\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

      "https://aliabdaal.com/why-autonomy-is-important-for-work/"
    ],
    "article_body": "So far on the book journey, I’ve found two things harder than expected. The first is figuring out what I want to say. The second is figuring out how to say it. I think I’ve finally cracked the first problem and I plan to share some lessons on that in future emails. These past few weeks, I’ve spent a lot of time figuring how to say what I want to say.\nWhen I think about non-fiction books that have changed my life, their core messages are always presented in a way that makes the message stick with you. For example, in James Clear’s Atomic Habits, the core message of small changes can lead to big differences is framed in terms of compound interest. Similar to how money multiplies through compound interest, James tells us that habits multiply to create big effects if you repeat them. As someone who thinks about money a fair bit and who struggles to stick to my gymshark athlete plan, having someone point out the similarities between growing money and growing habits just really clicked with me.\nBeing stuck on how to say something is strange… The best way I can describe it is that it’s sort of like knowing what presents you want to give someone but not knowing how to wrap up that present so that it’s a nice surprise. Should I put it in a bigger box so they don’t guess what the present is from its shape? What color wrapping paper should I use? Should the paper be patterned or not? Should I tie a ribbon around the present?\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we’ve been thinking a lot about freedom and autonomy in work. Something stood out in the responses to our last survey about energizers and drainers (more on this below). A lot of you said that you feel drained and bored when you don’t have control over the thing you’re doing. This got us thinking. Why is feeling a sense of control and autonomy important to enjoy what you do?\n The most interesting thing we learned\nIt turns out that a lot of you who responded to the survey were spot on about autonomy being an energizer and the lack of it being a drainer. In the late 1980s, two psychologists from the University of Rochester developed a theory about what we need to feel motivated to do something. They called this Self Determination Theory (SDT).\nSDT says that to feel motivated, we need to fulfil three basic psychological needs. The first is autonomy – the feeling that you have control over your goals, your day, and whether what you do is important. The other two factors are competence (the feeling that you are good at what you do) and relatedness (the feeling of being connected to other people).\n(By the way, you might be wondering what motivation has to do with being energized or drained. The answer is that usually when you’re drained by a task you probably can’t be motivated to do that task. If you’re energized by it, then you’re more motivated to do it).\nQuestion of the week\nIt seems like your personal stories and psychological research both show that autonomy is super important when it comes to doing things that energize and motivate us. This leads to the question of the week:\n When you feel stuck, drained, or unmotivated because you have to do something that you feel like you have no control over (e.g. your boss asks for a report by Friday), do you have any tips or techniques to help yourself feel like you have more control over what you have to do? ​\n​\nWe’re particularly interested in hearing about the following\n– Changing WHAT you do to gain more control (e.g. asking your boss if you can do a powerpoint rather than report)\n– Changing HOW you do it (e.g. asking to work from home)\n– Changing your MINDSET about what and how you do things (e.g. reminding yourself about things you like about your work)\nI’d love to hear from you about this. If you’re up for sharing a story that might feature in the book, please reply here.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details \n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey last week where we asked you about what tasks energize and drain you.\nWe loved your responses! Shoutout to Anna, Lina, and Sam who shared these insights.\nThanks to Anna for sharing how the key to feeling energized is finding CONNECTION. As someone who also loves to teach, this really resonated with me. Also, it’s pretty cool how connectedness is basically the relatedness part of the self-determination.\nI guess I could summarise my experience with one word: connection. I’m a teacher, and one of the things that energises me the most is teaching a class. Yet, I don’t leave the classroom feeling energised every day. When I feel the best is when there’s been a positive exchange; sometimes it has to do with learning, sometimes just with sharing.\nThanks also to Lina who showed the importance of knowing yourself and balancing the things that drain and energize you.\nI think these are all very personal, so it really depends on what kind of person you are. I am an introvert but I still enjoy hanging out with friends… So for me, spending enough time by myself is so crucial to get prepared for social events. When the amount of social time exceeded how much I originally planned for, any kinds of interactions drain me…. So I think finding balance is critical for activities that drain/energize you.\nAnd finally, thanks to Sam who said that deciding whether to respond to our survey was draining lol. We actually really appreciate this feedback and if you have any ideas on how to make these surveys less draining, please let us know here!\nContemplating whether or not to complete this survey was draining. The reward was not clear, as I didn’t know how my answer would be processed or if it would have value. I also had little positive, notable experiences completing surveys like this in the past. I was only motivated to do it after thinking of this answer and perceiving it as mildly interesting.\nWe’re looking forward to featuring a few more or your responses next week!\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    "category": "Studying",
    "link": [
      "https://aliabdaal.com/waterfall-method-study-schedule/"
    ],
    "article_body": "Let’s talk about the waterfall method to help manage your study schedule. Time is our one finite resource. Every week we’re given just 168 hours to work towards our goals, pursue our passions, and spend time with friends and family. And this is more like 80 or 90 hours once we’ve accounted for sleep, eating, and the other menial chores we complete on a daily basis. Either way, it’s not a lot of time.\nAs such, many of us say things like I don’t have time to study, to read or learn an instrument. We believe that our lack of time is a reasonable excuse for not doing something meaningful.\nBut the real problem isn’t that we’ve got no time. It’s that we’ve got no time management.\nPut simply, if we want to learn more, achieve more, and enjoy a more balanced lifestyle, we need to be smart about our schedules. Especially when it comes to studying.\nSo let me introduce you to the Waterfall Method of Time Management, which I’ve found to be a particularly effective way of organising my life.\nIt is not that we are given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it – Seneca\n\n 1. Study Goal (Yearly Time Management)\nThe first level of the Waterfall Method of Time Management is about appreciating the big picture, staying aligned with our dreams, and taking control of the direction of our life.\nFigure Out What’s Important\nWe need to recognise the important and meaningful aspects of our studies to ensure our daily work flow actually brings us closer to our goals.\nFor example, let’s say we want to be a doctor. By having this goal in mind we’re able to make better study decisions. So if we’re not sure whether to study a particular subject, we can ask ourselves does this bring me closer to my goal of being a doctor?. If not, it may be best to avoid it. Although, having said that, there’s always room to learn things you enjoy that may not directly contribute to these goals. Just try to find the right balance.\nIf we don’t set a long-term study goal, we run the risk of thinking everything’s important. We’ll tell ourselves that we just need to answer an email or complete some other important (but unrelated) task first, unaware that this constant distraction is taking us further from where we want to be.\nThe solution then is to set a clear study goal and make a clear plan for achieving it (as we’ll look at in more detail in the next few levels of the Waterfall Method).\nYou will never clear your plate so you can finally allow yourself to get to the good stuff. So you have to decide. What do you want to accomplish in this life? What’s important to you right now? – Brigid Schulte\nScope The Subject\nOnce we’ve figured out what’s important and know what we need to focus on, my advice is to begin by scoping the subject we’re looking to study. I came across this idea when I was studying at Cambridge, and personally I’ve found it to be totally worth it.\nScoping a subject is the process of outlining the big picture of what we’re trying to learn and understanding how each subtopic connects to that main subject and our eventual learning outcome.\nIt’s also pretty simple. All we need to do is hop on to Notion or Google Sheets (or even pen and paper) and write a list of all the subtopics we need to cover within the subject. Here’s how I did it at medical school:\n\nHaving scoped the subject we now have a clear overview of the work we need to complete, an obvious learning pathway, and a super helpful guide to manage our day-to-day study time (as we’ll see in a second).\n 2. Study Schedule (Weekly Time Management)\nWith a study goal in mind, we can begin breaking it down into weekly targets. This is something that studies have shown to be crucial in completing work efficiently, and helping us to manage our time well.\nMapping The Week\n \nWhy Map Our Week?\nOne of the staples of good time management is ensuring we’ve carved out enough time in our week dedicated to working on our chosen study goal. This helps spread out our workload and maintain consistency, allowing us to stay productive, relaxed, and stress-free.\nIt gives us more time to do the things we enjoy too. Making time for productive study lets us see the gaps in our schedule, which we can then use to attend social events, pursue our hobbies, and be guilt-free wastemen. It’s a win-win.\nHow to Map Our Week\nWhen it comes to actually planning the week, I’m a big fan of using a version of Roger Seip’s method of categorising our time into 4 categories (from his book Train Your Brain for Success):\n\n Green Time – time to work on important things that align with our study goals e.g. studying science if we want to become a doctor\n Red Time – time to work on things that support our ‘green time’ e.g. having a zoom call with a surgeon to offer us career advice\n Flex Time – gaps in our schedule to prepare for the unexpected and our bias towards being overly optimistic about what we can achieve in a given time frame (also called the planning fallacy)\n Recreation Time – time for hobbies, exercise, and relaxing\n\nBut, regardless of how we choose to manage our weekly plan, the most important thing to remember is pretty simple: we should be making time for goal-oriented tasks while also staying flexible enough to keep a healthy balance in our schedule.\nThe Retrospective Timetable\nWith our weekly plan in place, we can start thinking about how we spend our ‘green time’.\nMost people enjoy creating a fixed study timetable, where they study specific subjects in regular time slots throughout the week. I don’t like this method personally. The problem with fixed timetables is that they require us to look into the future and decide how many hours we’re going to dedicate to certain subjects before we’ve actually done any work.\nFor example, if we’re at school studying maths and physics, it’s impossible to know (at least to begin with) how much effort each subject will take to learn. Ideally, we’d have a weekly plan that takes this into account and lets us adapt our schedule depending on what we’re struggling with most.This is where a retrospective timetable works wonders.\n\nWith a retrospective timetable, every time we study one of our subtopics from our ‘scoped’ subject list (as seen in the image below) we put today’s date next to it and colour code it based on understanding (e.g. red if we found the subtopic hard or green if it was easy).\n\nThen when it comes to planning out the following week’s schedule, we should mainly fill our ‘green time’ with those subtopics that we find hard (those coloured red). That way, we’re practicing our weakest areas and completing cognitively demanding tasks more often, which increases the productive output of the time we spend studying.\nIt really is a great time management hack.\nIf you prefer to make a more forward-looking timetable, my friend and fellow YouTuber Simon Clark has a great method called The Spaced Repetition Diary. It combines the comfort of a schedule with the evidence-based power of Spaced Repetition. You can find out more about it in this video (it’s tip #1), or in my How to Study for Exams – An Evidence-Based Masterclass on Skillshare.\n\n⏰ 3. Study Blocking (Daily Time Management)\nKnowing how to manage our time on a daily basis through ‘blocking’ is only possible once we’ve understood our study goal and crafted a weekly plan that brings us closer to that target. And it forms the third level of the Waterfall Method of Time Management.\nThere are three components of study blocking:\n\nPrioritised To-Do Lists (these guide what we do within a study block)\nThe Pomodoro Technique (this guides the length of each block)\nInterleaving (this guides the order of our blocks throughout the day)\n\nPrioritised To-Do Lists\nAlthough this may not seem like a particularly groundbreaking idea, writing to-do lists help us to visualise what we want to achieve. And each completed task brings us one small step closer to our larger goal, in the same way that putting one foot in front of the other will help us finish a marathon. It’s simple, but effective.\nBut we also need to keep the Pareto Principle in mind:\n20 percent of our activities will account for 80 percent of our results\nIn other words, a well ordered to-do list that places the Most Important Tasks (MITs) first is vital for good time management, as it focuses our attention on the 20% of tasks that give us the largest results. Plus, as we then do these tasks earlier in the day or at the start of a new study block, we approach them with more energy and efficiency.\nAs a side note – I’ve also written an article about the 7 self-management skills I use to take control of the trajectory of my life and manage my time better, which may be worth reading.\n\nThe Pomodoro Technique\nAlthough there are many different micro time management techniques, perhaps the best-known method is The Pomodoro Technique.\nEssentially, every work block throughout the day is split into 25 minutes of focused study, followed by a 5 minute break. We then repeat this process 3-4 times, before taking a longer break of about 15 minutes.\nSplitting up our work in this way helps us to avoid what James Clear calls half-work. In other words, by blocking out smaller chunks of time in our schedule, we can more easily eliminate the useless distractions that divide our energy. Such as checking our notifications while writing an essay or reading emails when sat in a lecture.\nPlus, studying in narrow 25-minute time frames also places a healthy pressure on us to complete stuff faster and avoid the effects of Parkinson’s Law, where we end up working endlessly on a task.\nParkinson’s Law is the notion that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion\n\nInterleaving\nThe way we order our individual study blocks throughout the day also impacts the overall effectiveness of our learning. And, therefore, our study time management.\nWhen our time is poorly managed, we end up studying the same subject for many hours straight. This makes it difficult to retain knowledge, meaning we have to spend even more time reviewing the material and learning the subject.\nWhen our time is well managed, we interleave our study. In other words, we mix up the subjects we choose to learn on any given day, introducing variety into our study schedule and not spending too much time on a specific subject – abcbcacba instead of aaabbbccc.\nOne 2008 study found that interleaved study was a particularly effective technique for students to use in the run-up to an exam. They found that the maths students who mixed up revision subtopics throughout the day consistently outperformed those maths students who blocked out an entire day to focus on a single subtopic.\nSo, when it comes to our own daily tasks (or Pomodoros), it makes sense to jump between subjects and spread out our learning. That way, our brains have a better chance of strengthening memory associations and require less time to fully understand the material.\n\n 4. Study Flow (Continuous Time Management)\nThe final level of the Waterfall Method of Time Management is about finding our study flow – using strategies that keep us driven, productive, and having fun.\n\nFind our natural rhythm – our circadian and ultradian rhythms are responsible for our natural energy peaks and troughs throughout the day. Understanding how our bodies work lets us adapt to these changes and schedule relevant work at the most productive times. I’m naturally more energetic first thing in the morning, so that’s when I’ll write my book, schedule power hours, and do deep work. But, my energy is naturally lower in the mid-afternoon (especially after a big lunch), which makes it a great time to schedule phone calls as they don’t require much cognitive effort.\nTake regular breaks – good time management doesn’t mean we’ve got to be busy all the time. In fact, if we don’t take regular breaks we’re going to succumb to our urge to procrastinate or face mental burnout. (Which isn’t helpful, obviously). Other than getting enough sleep, I’ve found that exercise is a brilliant way to replenish energy levels and think more creatively when I’m actually working. And don’t just take my word for it. A 2015 study found that exercise actually induces profound structural brain plasticity. Put in a less nerdy way – our brain builds new connections assisting our ability to learn.\nAllow flexibility – we touched on this earlier, but we need to keep our schedule flexible. Everything won’t always go to plan, so it’s important to actively leave gaps in our day to mitigate any breakdown in our time management. Even Warren Buffett doesn’t overfill his schedule, making it easy for him to adapt to unexpected events or spend time doing what he enjoys (like playing the ukulele).\n\nHaving said all that, some distractions throughout our day are healthy. And being productive and time-efficient isn’t always possible. So yeah, it’s okay if your friends interrupt you at uni because that’s what uni life is all about lol. Don’t feel bad about it. Accept it as a welcome distraction that makes your day more exciting and interesting.\nConclusion\nThe best students are usually the best time-managers too. They’re very careful about how they spend every moment of their life, carefully mapping out their yearly goals, weekly plans, daily schedules, and finding their study flow.\nBy following the four levels of the Waterfall Method of Time Management, we can become brilliant learners too. Spending more time on tasks that are planned and meaningful to our study goals, rather than the unplanned and ineffective things that distract us every day.\nI’d also highly recommend signing up for my weekly newsletter where I share even more insights as to how we can manage our time more effectively and get more done, without sacrificing our health and happiness.\nAnd if you’re interested in more evidence-based tips for studying, you might like to check out my How to Study for Exams – An Evidence-Based Masterclass on Skillshare (you can sign up for the free trial, and then cancel your subscription if you don’t want to pay the $10/month subscription cost, although it’s totally worth it)."

    "article_body": "It might seem odd to have a blog post devoted entirely to reading more effectively. After all, if you’re reading this, chances are you can read. But reading effectively and efficiently is its own skill – one that we’re never really taught how to do.\nThroughout our academic life, we’re programmed to believe that effective reading is measured by speed and breadth. The more we can read, the smarter we look. And the more broadly we can read, the more intelligent we seem.\nIn fact, I’ve fallen prey to this myself, making a clickbait video called How I Read 100 Books a Year. Full disclosure: I don’t actually. It’s closer to 50. But that makes for a less clickable video (sorry, not sorry).\nBecause of this obsession we have with reading more, we miss out on a lot of valuable insights. Wisdom from across the ages, the lessons mastered by people who’ve overcome extraordinary challenges, and the chance to gain knowledge that challenges our beliefs. All because we’re never taught the ultimate meta-skill: the art of reading.\nReading more effectively and efficiently means developing a watertight process to capture ideas, analyse arguments, and ask the right questions. It means identifying the right books to read, understanding the different reading goals, and using evidence-based techniques to increase reading productivity.\nIn many ways, improving the way we read is the number one skill that can change our lives for the better.\nThe Importance of Effective &amp; Efficient Reading\nA person who won’t read has no advantage over one who can’t read – Mark Twain\nBooks have had an enormous impact on my own life. They’ve acted as a personal mentor, and as a vehicle for compounding knowledge.\n Books have been my Personal Mentors\nIf someone asked me to name the most influential people in shaping my life (outside of my immediate family), I wouldn’t find it too hard to identify a group of people who’ve transformed my thinking through their incredible actions, ideas, and journeys. But the number one influence in my life wouldn’t be people at all. It would be books.\nBy reading lots of books (and by trying to read effectively), I’ve managed to accumulate decades worth of knowledge and experience from the world’s most incredible minds, with minimal personal effort. I’ve learned from mistakes without having to fail, I’ve learned from successes without having to take huge risks, and I’ve travelled thousands of miles without leaving the comfort of my bed in Cambridge.\nReading is the mentor without the cost, the pain, and the discomfort. I honestly wouldn’t have started 6med, my YouTube channel, or decided to write a book without the encouragement, motivation, inspiration, and boundless insights offered by my paper friends. Seriously. My only regret is that I didn’t learn to read properly sooner.\n\n Books help us Compound Knowledge\nCompound interest is the 8th Wonder of the World – Albert Einstein\nJust as money accumulates exponentially, so too does personal knowledge as it snowballs and branches out over time. In other words, the more we read and the better our reading processes are, the more our ideas, beliefs, and opinions begin to develop at an ever-increasing rate.\nNot only does our brain begin effortlessly creating connections between seemingly disparate pieces of information, but cohesive and creative solutions to some of our most puzzling and perplexing problems gradually emerge. It’s a personal superpower that all of us have the opportunity to discover.\nTo develop a complete mind: Study the science of art; Study the art of science. Learn how to see. Realise that everything connects to everything else – Da Vinci\nThe Reading Objective\nIncreasing our ability to read more effectively, as a means to unlock our own personal potential, begins by deciding on a reading goal. After all, we’re probably going to have a different objective and experience reading Paradise Lost compared to our favourite Harry Potter book.\nMany brilliant authors talk about books as having a rather loose objective of success, happiness, and personal fulfilment. Roald Dahl, for instance, said that if you are going to get anywhere in life, you have to read a lot of books. And J. K. Rowling once said that something very magical can happen when you read a good book.\nBut I’d agree, these opinions are abstract, subjective, and largely unhelpful in guiding the way in which we should read. Instead, it’s easier and more useful for our purposes to segment reading objectives into three distinct categories, as identified by Mortimer Adler in How to Read a Book.\n Category 1: Reading to Entertain\nIn this category, we read books purely for enjoyment. It’s how we spend the majority of our time as readers. There are no rules and there’s no need to think too deeply or critically about what we’re reading. The goal is simple: we can relax and immerse ourselves in the story.\nThere’s nothing inherently wrong with reading to entertain ourselves.\nIt’s a healthy way to escape from everyday stress and, if you’re anything like me, a perfect way to finish a productive day of work. In particular, I enjoy reading (or listening to) fantasy novels (with the Brandon Sanderson books being a personal favourite). I even created a video on My Favourite Fantasy Books, which you can check out if you’re interested.\n Category 2: Reading to Inform\nIn this second category, we read books to learn specific facts or information about something. These books are typically easy to navigate and simple in their layout and structure. This lets us consume them effortlessly and jump around to relevant sections without losing the gist of what’s being said. The goal is to learn without judgement.\nFor example, we’d read the newspaper, a tourist guide, or the Guinness World Records, all to inform. Although we may find aspects of each of them entertaining, we primarily read these things to develop a factual picture of current affairs, a particular location, or some other snippet of knowledge.\nAgain, for most of us, reading to inform isn’t too problematic.\n Category 3: Reading to Understand\nIt’s the final category of reading – reading to understand – that most of us (including me) tend to struggle with. It therefore deserves most of our attention when it comes to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our reading.\nThe problem is that out of the three reading categories, reading to understand requires the greatest cognitive effort. It forces us to challenge our preconceptions, critically analyse the status quo, and directly confront ideas that we may not be immediately comfortable with. This is hard. It can be uncomfortable. But it’s the only way for us to level-up our thinking and personal growth.\nUltimately, this is a skill that few of us have mastered. But it’s at the very heart of meaningful productivity and improving the way we read. Therefore, we need a method that takes us from reading at an elementary level (like when we’re reading to entertain and inform) to reading at an analytical or syntopical level.\nLet’s dive into how we can do this.\nThe Four Levels of Reading\n\nWhile the three categories of reading help guide our reading goal, the four cumulative levels of reading help guide our reading style. These levels were again devised by Mortimer Adler and operate to help us understand a book at a far deeper level than what most of us are used to. As we move up the levels we’ll not only find ourselves more capable of grasping the author’s perspectives and forge deeper insights, but we’ll have a process that works with every single book we decide to read.\nThis is great stuff.\n Level 1: Elementary Reading\nThe first level of reading is the style of reading that everyone knows how to do, as it’s what we’re taught in school. As an elementary reader we can easily understand the words on the page, follow the plot, and have a solid grasp of what the book is trying to say.\nHowever, even at this elementary level, it’s easy to screw it up by trying to read too quickly.\nAs you know, I’m all about increasing productivity, but trying to improve reading speed before understanding the fundamentals of effective reading is only going to hinder our capacity to learn new information.\nMy advice – we should try and first improve our reading level. Then, once we’ve mastered the art of reading analytically, we can worry about reading faster (and we’ll talk more about this later).\nEvery book should be read no more slowly than it deserves, and no more quickly than you can read it with satisfaction and comprehension – Adler\n Level 2: Inspectional Reading\nThis second level of reading requires marginally more skill than at the elementary reading level. As an inspectional reader we’re tasked with unearthing the overall framework of the book and mapping out the general picture the author is trying to paint. The idea is that we’re making some preliminary calculations about the book’s content and worth before delving into it properly.\nThere are two aspects to inspectional reading: systematic skimming and superficial reading.\nSystematic Skimming\nWith systematic skimming our aim is to decide whether or not this is a book we actually want to spend the time reading. I like to ask myself is this one of the greats that I’d happily spend the next few hours of my life looking at?. If the answer is anything less than hell yes! then I won’t bother reading it.\nTo help me answer this question, I first look at the title, the blurb, and the contents page to determine what the book is about and understand its high-level structure. I then flip through the book concentrating on each chapter’s introduction, conclusion, and any sub-headings that interest me. In other words, I do a surface level examination of the book before writing a couple of sentences that neatly summarises everything.\nAnother way to systematically skim a book is by reading a book summary. My favourite way of doing this is with the service Shortform. If a book’s available on Shortform (they’re always adding new titles), I’ll read through the summary first, and if I think it’s interesting, I’ll buy the book on Kindle and read it properly.\nSuperficial Reading\nThe objective of superficial reading is to quickly read the book without stopping to reflect or analyse. Speed reading isn’t a problem here as we’re still not reading to understand, but seeing if it is interesting enough to continue onwards to level 3. This process shouldn’t take too long. And if the book doesn’t instantly grab us, we can just put it down. There are plenty of better books we could be reading.\nA quick note – Sometimes, a book might be really good, but we’ve just encountered it at the wrong time. That’s okay. We don’t have to read it if we don’t find it interesting right now. We can always come back to it later.\n Level 3: Analytical Reading\nThe third level of reading is about examining the book in-depth. I’ll be honest – I’m not great at this level of reading, but I’m always trying to improve.\nAnalytical reading involves discovering the book’s central meaning, evaluating the author’s arguments, and developing a thorough understanding of the book.\nSome books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested – Francis Bacon\nIn particular, this level requires us to actively read the book and the more active the reading the better (Adler). I’m a big fan of just making the book my own by highlighting text, linking arguments, and synthesising information through marginalia.\nMarking a book is literally an experience of your differences or agreements with the author. It is the highest respect you can pay him – Edgar Allen Poe\nHowever, perhaps the most critical component of active reading is continually questioning what we’re being told. Specifically, there are three core questions that we should be asking when reading a book analytically:\nThe Holistic Stage: What is the book about as a whole?\nWe largely uncover the answer to this question during the systematic skimming and superficial reading within level 2. The main difference is that, in the holistic stage of level 3, we’re tasked with identifying the questions the author is asking and trying to solve. Put another way, what was it the author was trying to answer by writing this book?\nFurthermore, our written summary of the book is going to be more comprehensive than a couple of sentences. Think about how the structure and ideas flow in general, helping to guide us to the given conclusion.\nThe Specific Stage: What is the book saying in detail and how is it being said?\nWhile reading the book, we need to ensure we’ve fully understood the author’s approach and be comfortable with interpreting their thinking. We should take the time to identify the special keywords that the author has chosen, verify our understanding of them, and try to appreciate their perspective.\nIn each chapter, the author will also make certain claims and propositions, which we should restate in our own words and decide whether or not their argument is strong. We should carefully evaluate how these claims and propositions are connected, and check to see they flow logically from one point to the next.\nThe Veracity Stage: Is the book true, whether in whole or in part?\nIn the veracity stage, our task is to constructively analyse. To show where the author has been uninformed, misinformed, illogical or incomplete in their arguments, clearly explaining what the shortcomings are and how the author’s reasoning could be improved. If we can’t do that then our criticism is unlikely to be constructive or valid.\nThe person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks – Adler\n Level 4: Syntopical Reading\nThe final level of reading is about our understanding of a subject more generally. Whereas analytical reading focuses on our comprehension of a specific book, syntopical reading helps shape our opinion and increase our overall fluency of the wider topic through understanding how different books relate to one another. This may sound a little abstract, but bear with me.\nThe benefits [of syntopical reading] are so great that it is well worth the trouble of learning how to do it – Adler\nThe first step is to begin by deciding the subject we want to tackle (eg: productivity or habit-formation). We can then draw up a bibliography of books on the topic, and select just a handful of them that we believe to be most relevant.\nHaving compiled the list of books, we can begin reading syntopically. This means reading each of the books analytically and building mental connections between each of them. I try to define common subject keywords in my own words, identify and answer the most pressing questions that the books collectively address, and make an informed decision about the strengths of each author’s argument.\nCreativity is just connecting things – Steve Jobs\nThrough syntopical reading we’re connecting the best ideas on a subject, which acts as a powerful catalyst giving rise to creative solutions and real insight. It’s truly game-changing (when we actually do it).\nHow to Read More\nOnly once we’ve mastered how to read effectively, by working up the four levels, should we think about reading efficiently.\nReading more exposes us to more opinions, helps us build connections between different ideas, and entrenches our existing knowledge. Think of effective reading as a well constructed rocket, and efficient reading as a necessary upgrade to its performance. It just takes things up a notch.\nThere are three steps to reading more:\n Step 1 – Love to Read\nThe first step of reading more is having the willingness to read more. And falling in love with the act of reading itself.\nIf you don’t already love reading, Naval offers some valuable advice:\nRead what you love until you love to read\nIn other words, don’t just pick up the classics because that’s what clever people do. Find the books written on topics that fascinate you and by those people you admire most. Just as we can fall in love with exercise by finding the sports we enjoy, we can fall in love with reading by finding the books we enjoy. The ‘fun factor’ is essential to productive reading.\nSimilarly, if you begin reading a book and you aren’t enjoying it, then there’s no obligation to continue. Just stop. We don’t need to finish a book just because we started it. Otherwise we’d be committing to a classic sunk cost fallacy, investing further time into a book simply because we’ve spent valuable time on it already.\nThe truth is most books won’t deserve our attention. So find the books you love and discard the rest.\n Step 2 – Make it Easy to Access Books\nMake it as easy as possible to pick up a book and read it.\nIf there’s one piece of advice I’d recommend here, it would be listening to audiobooks – particularly when reading to entertain rather than to understand. Personally, I’ve found audiobooks to be pretty awesome when working out or driving in my car, as this allows me to incorporate ‘reading’ into my life where I’d previously have been too busy. There’s literally no excuse for not reading.\nHowever, when reading to understand and analyse, we’re going to want to actually carry the book around with us. Even a Kindle would suffice. That way we no longer have to waste time in queues, on public transport, or even when going to the toilet. Throughout the day you’ll find numerous opportunities to spend 5 or 10 minutes reading. So keep a book nearby. You don’t know when the next great reading opportunity will arise.\nOther than that, try minimising distractions. One study in 2009 found that we’re exposed to approximately 100,000 words each day from all the media and information we consume. By comparison, that’s about the same length as one-quarter of War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy. It’s a constant stream of disturbances that impede our ability to think and limit our desire to read well.\nIf you’re struggling with this, try creating a comfortable reading space, downloading a productivity app, or just being more mindful with your note taking. Anything that increases your focus.\n Step 3 – Work on Improving your Reading Techniques\nThe final, and least important aspect of effective and efficient reading, is technique. This is typically where most articles on reading begin but I’ve realised that this stuff is pointless unless everything else is in order.\nIf there’s one reading technique that’s going to help the most, it’s improving our consistency. Consistency really is king. Just as the key to YouTube growth is posting 1-3 new videos every week, the key to reading growth is picking up our book for a small chunk of time every day. Although James Clear recommends reading 20 pages at the start of our day, I think it’s easier to set a time target of 20 minutes. And if we have an average reading speed of 250 words per minute, we’ll roughly get through a book every week by doing this. Small actions really do lead to big results (see my video review of Atomic Habits for more on this).\nMaking a public commitment to reading is also incredibly powerful. In one study, it was found that the simple act of betting on a horse to win, and publicly committing to it, elevated the punter’s confidence in their chosen horse’s chance of winning. Taking a stand placed pressure on them to behave consistently with that commitment. Similarly, by using a site like Goodreads (please follow me lol), we can remain accountable and place reasonable pressure on ourself to stay true to our reading goals.\nThe final reading technique is speed reading. However, this comes with a word of warning: only speed read books that you don’t want to understand. Why is that? Well, when reading at speed we’re not going to have the time to think about what is being said or develop the insights necessary for true comprehension. As Woody Allen humorously observed: I took a speed-reading course and read War and Peace in twenty minutes. It involves Russia.\nDespite this, reducing subvocalisation, reading the middle, and using a pointer are all valid speed reading techniques that may be appropriate with inspectional reading or when reading to inform.\nIn the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you – Adler\nConclusion\nReading is hard work, but if we want to rapidly build our knowledge and have high-impact ideas then it’s a crucial skill to learn. No true genius has got to where they were without understanding the importance of effective and efficient reading. It really is the number one factor that will change your life forever. I promise.\nIf you’re ready to commit to levelling up, why not check out the Notion template I use to take notes when reading. It incorporates the advice in this article and gives you a simple framework to capture your thoughts as you read.\nYou’ll never look at books the same way ever again."

    "article_body": "We do almost anything to avoid feeling bored.\nAs soon as our interest in an activity begins to decline we quickly turn to playing games, replying to messages, or engaging with some other easily-accessible distraction. We do this to avoid the mental discomfort of boredom. We’re never too far away from something to stimulate us or give us a quick dopamine hit.\nThis may not sound like a massive problem. After all, what’s the use in being bored? I certainly don’t enjoy the feeling and I’ll always try to find a way to avoid it.\nBut as I’ve recently discovered, being bored is actually a very good thing for us. Its benefits include:\n\nBoosted creativity\nEnhanced productivity\nEffortless goal setting\nNovelty exposure\n\nSo while most people are chasing ways to keep their brain stimulated, we can level up our own lives by doing the opposite: learning to unplug, slow down, and embrace boredom.\nWhat is Boredom?\nContrary to popular belief, we don’t just get bored because we’ve got nothing to do. There’s always something on our to-do list, a chore we need to complete, or an essay we need to write. If anything, we’ve got way too much to do.\nThe problem then – and the real reason we get bored – is that none of these activities appeal to us right now. So although we’ve got lots of gadgets to play with and a stack of work we need to finish, if it doesn’t immediately excite us we think ughh, there’s nothing to do. This is boredom.\nBoredom stems from a situation where none of the possible things that a person can realistically do appeal to the person in question. This renders the person inactive, and generally unhappy. – Sandi Mann\nFor most of us, boredom is a negative experience. In fact, one study described boredom as an extremely unpleasant and distressing experience that left respondents feeling stressed, agitated, [and] lethargic.\nAs such, there’s some evidence to suggest that being bored has a negative impact on work and learning. Studies show that bored workers have lower levels of performance, are more likely to make errors, or simply not show up. In the education context, bored students tend to receive lower test scores and are more likely to give up.\nNo wonder we’re constantly trying to avoid it.\nThe fantastic book ‘Bullshit Jobs‘ contains lots of testimony from people working in boring and meaningless jobs – Here’s one of my favourites, from a guy whose job involved scanning application forms:\nIt is hard to explain what this level of entranced boredom was like. I found myself conversing with God, pleading for the next record to contain an error, or the next one, or the next. There was really nothing of any value riding on how we did the job, [which] made it feel like some sort of personal test of stamina, like Olympic endurance boredom for its own sake.\nResisting Boredom: Our Personal Shock Buttons\nIn a 2014 study called ‘The challenges of the disengaged mind‘, participants were placed in a room alone, for up to 15 minutes, with nothing to do but think. They also had the choice to give themselves an electric shock by pushing a button placed next to them.\nEven though there was absolutely no pressure on the participants to shock themselves (and many of them said they’d pay money to avoid the shock beforehand), 25% of women and 67% of men still chose to push the button.\nPut simply – people would rather experience physical pain than be bored.\nThis may sound ridiculous, but in a way, we all do the same thing every day.\nAny time we engage in an otherwise pointless distraction to avoid boredom, we’re pushing our ‘personal shock button’. Or, as Knapp and Zeratsky put it in their brilliant book ‘Make Time‘, we enjoy diving into ‘infinity pools’. Whether it’s checking social media, the news, or reading emails, there’s an infinite supply of content helping us to stave off boredom. And it keeps refreshing.\n\nAnother common ‘personal shock button’ is our unhealthy obsession with being busy all the time. I’m definitely guilty of hopping on to the ‘busy bandwagon‘ to avoid boredom. We try to squeeze productivity into every minute of the day and move at a hundred miles per hour as a way of handling the discomfort of doing nothing at all. By staying busy there’s literally no room for boredom to creep in, even if that means our work is unfocused or unfulfilling.\nIt’s a pretty crazy way to live our lives. And we’re missing out on some serious learning benefits as a result.\nAll of humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone. – Pascal\nSo what’s the solution? I haven’t the foggiest.\nBut one helpful idea I’ve been playing around with, is to embrace ‘boring brilliance’.\nEmbrace ‘Boring Brilliance’\nThere are four key ways in which boredom can help us to become better learners. And reveal what I like to call our ‘boring brilliance’.\n1. Boredom Boosts Creativity\nWhen we’re bored our minds wander to interesting (and surprisingly productive) places. So instead of having a narrow focus on any specific task, we begin to adopt a more diffuse mode of thinking, as Barbara Oakley put it in ‘A Mind for Numbers‘.\nIn other words, our brain is free to jump between different ideas and concepts, which is the ideal state for creative problem solving and lateral thinking.\nMany studies also recognise the link between boredom and creativity. In one of these studies, two-thirds of the participants were told to do something really boring – reading or writing the numbers from a phone book – and the rest were the control group (with non-boring conditions). After a short period of time both groups were asked to do a creative activity that involved listing as many uses for two polystyrene cups as they could. It was found that the participants in the ‘boring group’ listed significantly more creative ways to use the cups compared to the control group.\nOn an individual basis, if one is trying to solve a problem or come up with creative solutions, the findings from our studies suggest that undertaking a boring task (especially a reading task) might help with coming up with a more creative outcome. – Sandi Mann\nI’ve found this to be true too. Some of my best video ideas come when I’m doing some mindless task, like washing the dishes or cleaning my flat. There’s just something about disconnecting from focused work that works wonders when it comes to being more creative.\n2. Boredom Enhances Productivity\nAs well as increasing our idea quality (i.e. creativity), boredom also increases our idea quantity. Seriously, doing less work can apparently make us more productive.\nA 2018 study got participants to sort a bowl of beans by colour. When they were later asked to think of some creative reasons for being two hours late for work, they came up with far more ideas compared to the control group (who’d completed an interesting art activity beforehand).\nSo if we ever feel like we’ve got no good ideas for an essay or some other project, it may be worthwhile allowing ourselves to be bored for a bit.\nBoredom [helps] boost individual productivity on an idea-generation task. – Park, Lim and Oh\nPerhaps surprisingly, boredom also helps us to increase our levels of concentration. The idea is that if we can endure feeling bored, without reaching for any of our ‘personal shock buttons’, we can train our brain to be comfortable with mentally unpleasant experiences.\nThe problem is, many of us seek to avoid feeling bored by constantly jumping from low-stimuli, high value activities (like deep work) to high-stimuli, low value activities (like social media). As a result, we build up zero tolerance to boredom and develop an inability to concentrate.\nSo, instead, we should be embracing boredom. That way we become more resilient to its discomforting feeling and stay focused for longer.\nMuch in the same way that athletes must take care of their bodies outside of their training sessions, you’ll struggle to achieve the deepest levels of concentration if you spend the rest of your time fleeing the slightest hint of boredom. – Deep Work by Cal Newport\n3. Boredom Helps us Establish Meaningful Goals\nThe distressing feeling we get when we’re bored acts like a mental alarm bell to tell us an activity isn’t particularly pleasant, stimulating, or interesting. And therefore helps us to get out of the situation as quickly as possible.\nIn other words, boredom can make us reevaluate what we’re doing, and motivate us to shift our goals to another activity that better meets our expectations or desires.\nThis is known as autobiographical planning. Essentially, when we’re bored our mind-wandering becomes largely future-focused and we think a lot more about what we want from our life.\nIn one study, researchers found that ‘bored’ participants frequently turned their minds to their future plans, helping them to set more meaningful long-term goals and subconsciously plan the next steps they need to take to get there.\nMy general philosophy is that we can’t expect to learn anything without knowing what our objective actually is. Letting our brain wander and engage in autobiographical planning can be incredibly helpful in discovering and realising our learning goals.\nA significant proportion of the imaginative opportunities afforded by the mind-wandering state are devoted to prospection. – Baird, Smallwood and Schooler\n4. Boredom Exposes us to Novelty\nFinally, boredom is what gives us a taste for adventure and encourages us to seek out novelty – the ingredients that help cultivate humans as an intelligent and curious species.\nFor instance, Charles Darwin had an expansive curiosity often sparked by boredom. On one occasion, in his early life, he quickly got bored of searching for orchids and decided to take a look at some sundews instead. As this was a carnivorous plant, he was interested to see what these plants would eat. So, Darwin conducted a fool’s experiment (as he liked to call them) where he fed the sundews his hair and toenail clippings. It turns out the sundews weren’t too interested in eating Darwin’s toenails (I can’t blame them really).\nBut that’s not the point of this story. The key takeaway is that Darwin’s seemingly unremarkable beginning, seeking novelty from boredom, is what led to an interesting series of studies culminating in The Origin of Species, which completely changed the way we think about nature.\nSo if we want to become better learners we need to be more comfortable exploring the adventure and novelty that boredom offers us. If we don’t allow ourselves to be bored we’d be less motivated to challenge accepted ideas and practices. And therefore miss out on opportunities to further our own knowledge and understanding of the world.\nBoredom is a discrete functional emotion, and serves to encourage people to seek new goals and experiences. – Bench and Lench\nIncorporating Boredom\nTo tap into my ‘boring brilliance’, I’ve recently started trying to incorporate more boredom into my life. As such, I want to share the three methods that I’ve found work best:\n\nDo mindless activities – to experience true boredom we need to find an activity that needs no stimulation or concentration. For example, walking a familiar route, sitting with our eyes closed, or standing in a queue. But, it’s important not to conflate boredom with relaxation. Activities such as meditation and yoga, for instance, don’t make us bored as they’re designed to remove those feelings rather than encourage them.\nDisconnect – our constant scrolling is the main reason why we’re unable to take advantage of our ‘boring brilliance’. Every time we decide to go on social media or randomly browse the internet at the slightest hint of boredom, we’re destroying our ability to be creative and curious. We can’t let our mind wander if we’re always filling our time with stimulating activities. Using an app like Flipd or WasteNoTime can help those of us who find disconnecting particularly difficult. I’ve personally found the bedtime feature on iOS to be great for blocking my notifications at night, so I’m less likely to turn to Twitter or Instagram when I’m bored before bed.\nSchedule boredom – we’re so used to living busy lives with never ending to-do lists, we rarely have any time to ourselves. This is why it’s so important to actively schedule time for boredom into our calendar. It could be giving ourselves just 10 minutes to sit quietly during a lunch break or first thing in the morning. If there are other opportunities during the day where we’re feeling bored and tempted to whip out our phone, try to do nothing at all. Accept our boredom, observe our surroundings, and explore our ‘boring brilliance’. In all honesty, this is the one I struggle most with, but it’s a work in progress.\n\nConclusion\nBoredom shouldn’t be something we fear or avoid. Although it’s an uncomfortable experience, it’s also responsible for unlocking huge amounts of personal creativity and productivity.\nIf we decide to distract ourselves every time we feel a little bit bored we’re seriously limiting our ability to learn, to discover our life mission, and achieve incredible things. Scheduling time for mindless activities is more important than ever and, in my opinion, is totally worth it."

    "article_body": "If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough – Albert Einstein (attributed)\nWhen we learn something, it’s easy to convince ourselves that we’ve understood it too. But, are we really learning effectively? Have we understood the concept or simply memorised some sentences?\nThe problem with the learning techniques most of us use (like highlighting, summarising, and rereading) is that, although they feel intuitively productive, they’re not very effective or useful in improving knowledge retention. So instead of using techniques that will help our knowledge to compound over time, we’re essentially resorting to learning hacks that help us quickly pass a test. This is a trap we’ve all fallen into at some point. I know I certainly have.\nFortunately, this is where the Feynman technique can help.\n The Greatest Teacher I Never Had\nDuring his lifetime, he pioneered the field of quantum electrodynamics, re-invented our understanding of particle physics through his visual representation of subatomic particles, and won the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics. Beyond theoretical physics, he was an influential figure in the Manhattan Project, wrote a detailed report on the causes of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, and had an incredible ability to communicate complex ideas with clarity and simplicity.\nHis name was Richard Feynman.\nBut it wasn’t his innate intelligence that made Feynman so brilliant (at least, according to the man himself). Rather, it was his systematic method of understanding, simplifying, and explaining difficult concepts that contributed far more to his eventual success.\nThis method is now called ‘The Feynman Technique’.\nRichard Feynman\n The Feynman Technique\nThe Feynman technique is based around the idea that one of the most effective techniques to enhance our understanding is to imagine that we’re teaching the material to someone who has absolutely no idea about the topic. Like a small child.\nBy doing this, we force ourselves to explain our thoughts fully and avoid glossing over topics we don’t understand well enough. Through the 4-steps of the Feynman technique I’ve outlined below, we’re encouraged to identify our knowledge gaps, reorganise our thoughts, and ultimately improve our long-term retention of that knowledge.\n\nIdentify the topic\nTeach it to a child\nIdentify knowledge gaps\nSimplify\n\nWe’ll look at each of these steps in turn.\n1. Identify the Topic\nThe first step is to choose a topic we’ve recently studied and/or a topic we’d like to test our knowledge and understanding. This can literally be any topic we want.\nMy recommendation is to grab a piece of paper and write this topic clearly at the top of the page. Try not to pick a topic that’s too broad (e.g. medicine) otherwise it’s going to be impossible to do step 2 properly. Just identify a topic that’s narrow enough to explain in no more than 5 minutes.\nWhat are the learning benefits of identifying the topic?\n\nIt makes learning specific – our focus is on one topic area, rather than an entire subject. So we know exactly what we have to know/learn.\nIt keeps things simple – learning a smaller, more specific, topic makes it far quicker to complete the 4 steps of the Feynman technique. So we’re less likely to get bored or give up while learning/revising.\nWe face our weaknesses – when we memorise it’s easy for us to skip over things we don’t enjoy. But by identifying our topic we’re facing our weaknesses and forced to confront what we don’t know.\n\n2. Teach it to a Child\nPretend we’re teaching and explaining the topic to a small child or someone who’s never come across the topic before. The key here is simplicity – explain the concept using simple language. Don’t simply define the concept but, if it is a mathematical concept for instance, work through examples to show how the concept works in practice.\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool – Richard Feynman\nThe classic mistake is to treat learning as a passive process. Rereading and highlighting are particularly popular learning techniques, but they’re largely ineffective because we’re not actually engaging with the material in any meaningful way. Teaching, on the other hand, is an active method of learning that is far more effective. After all, we can’t teach something without first understanding it properly.\nMy advice – take your piece of paper and explain your chosen topic in detail in your own words. Try to keep it brief, avoid technical jargon, and use example/analogies wherever possible.\nWhat are the learning benefits of teaching the topic?\n\nThere’s no hiding – when we teach a topic, we can’t shy away from the things we don’t know. If there’s a gap in our knowledge, we’ll quickly find it. Remember: teaching is a feedback loop for finding what we don’t know, not for explaining what we do know.\nWe get external feedback – when we learn through note taking it’s very difficult for us to tell when we’ve learnt something sufficiently well. But, when we try to explain a topic to someone else, they’ll often let us know if they don’t understand something or if our explanation needs further simplification.\n\n3. Identify Knowledge Gaps\nIn step three, we need to pinpoint the areas we found difficult to explain or had to return to our notes/textbooks to refresh our understanding. If we had to use any technical term in our explanation, we should challenge ourselves to break those terms into simpler components.\nIf a child would struggle to understand us, we’ve found a knowledge gap that needs to be filled and simplified in step 4. The key is not only to identify complex areas of our own explanations but also to challenge and identify where we’ve made assumptions based on what we already understand intuitively. A child won’t intuitively know much about our topic, so we need to make sure our explanations strip things back to the basics.\nWhat are the learning benefits of identifying knowledge gaps?\n\nIt is an active way to learn – by identifying where we’re struggling, we become more intentional about our learning. Instead of covering the stuff we already know (like we do when we reread, highlight, and summarise), we automatically focus our attention on the topics that need the most work.\nLearning is iterative – it’s impossible to remember a topic if we only look at it once. The Feynman technique, however, rewards repetition. By teaching a topic and filling in knowledge gaps multiple times, we’re more likely to encode this knowledge into our long-term memory.\n\n\n4. Simplify\nThe final step of the Feynman technique is to rewrite our explanation of a topic in simpler terms. This often involves re-organising our thoughts so the explanation flows more naturally, finishing incomplete thoughts, and finding simpler examples to break down complex ideas. This may take some time (or may have to be done multiple times) to get right.\nWhat are the learning benefits of simplifying?\n\nUnderstanding starts with simplicity – we don’t understand something unless we can explain it simply. Using technical language or assuming our listener has an existing baseline of knowledge means we’re probably relying on memorisation, rather than understanding.\nWe build confidence – if we’re able to teach someone a topic we previously found confusing, it boosts our confidence and encourages us to learn even more.\n\n Why use the Feynman Technique?\nAlthough it appears to be a simple technique, it’s highly effective.\nThe technique enables us to quickly overview a concept, identify areas that are weaker and, critically, requires active learning – we are forced to move beyond passively rereading or highlighting and actively think about how we would explain a particular concept in simple terms.\nIt also automatically removes memorisation from our learning process. In school, we memorise pretty much everything and quickly forget it all once we’ve finished our exams. But the Feynman technique goes much further, expecting us to prove our understanding of a given topic and clarify our thoughts.\nFinally, the Feynman technique pushes us to explore topics that interest us more deeply. And this is the essence of learning anything: be curious and fall in love with what you’re learning. If we can have fun and enjoy the journey, then the learning will take care of itself.\nFall in love with some activity, and do it! Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn’t matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough. Work as hard and as much as you want to on the things you like to do the best. Don’t think about what you want to be, but what you want to do. Keep up some kind of a minimum with other things so that society doesn’t stop you from doing anything at all – Richard Feynman\n\n Conclusion\nIf we want to learn more effectively and deepen our understanding of a topic, there’s really no better method than the Feynman technique. Every student should add it to their armoury of revision tools. In fact, every learner should leverage it to enhance understanding, increase productivity, and improve performance. It’s genuinely so useful regardless of what we’re looking to learn.\nAlongside the Feynman technique there are a bunch of other well-kept secrets on how to study effectively. Stuff we’re never really taught how to do at school. Fortunately, I did some research and collected all of my findings into an evidence-based course on Skillshare that you should check out if you’re interested.

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nI originally set myself a deadline to complete the draft of my book by the end of March 2022. That deadline is about a week away. But the draft of the book is quite a distance away…\nThe good news is that I’m feeling okay about this. I’m enjoying the process of refining and researching the ideas for this book. As I often tell myself and my team, I’d rather take a bit more time to write a decent draft than meet an artificial deadline with a bad draft. What’s more, I feel energised whenever I work on the book and talk to people about it.\n What we worked on this week\nThis week, we took a deep dive into the following topics:\n\nAnxiety and procrastination – The responses to our recent survey showed that a lot of people experience anxiety, fear, and pain around procrastination. We wanted to understand that better: What is anxiety? Where does it come from? How does it manifest? How is it related to procrastination?\nEnergisers and drainers – One thing that I hear a lot is I just don’t have the time or energy to do X. Is there a way to fix this? We wanted to understand whether there are any solutions to common problem. Is it possible to get more energy from the things that we have to do?\n\n The most interesting thing we learned\nOur research on energisers and drainers reminded me of my conversation with behavioural scientist turned dating coach Logan Ury. At some point during our conversation on my podcast, I asked her how we can check-in with ourselves after a date.\nLogan suggested this simple exercise called penthouse vs basement person. The exercise involves asking yourself: Did that person energise me or de-energise me? Someone who is a penthouse person would bring your energy levels up, make you feel creative, and make you feel inspired. Someone who is a basement person would do the opposite.\nSo, lately, we’ve been thinking about how to apply this penthouse vs basement idea to the concept of work. And I’ve learned a couple of things along the way:\n\nSometimes doing a hard but fun activity can be more energising than doing an easy but fun activity. Other times, doing an easy activity is the exact thing I need to recharge. For example, there are times when playing World of Warcraft for 3 hours is what I need to reset and other times when doing that leaves me depleted and wishing that I had done something else like learning The Joker and the Queen by Ed Sheeran on guitar.\nThe same activity can have different effects on our energy. Days in the hospital looked pretty similar if you just looked at it from a timetable perspective – I was seeing patients, writing up records, discharging patients. Yet, there were days when I felt energised at the end of a shift and other times when I felt completely drained.\n\nThis might seem obvious – yeah, of course some activities energise us more than others!. But it’s not obvious to me why different activities or why the same activity done at different times affects our energy in different ways. My hunch is that how we feel after an activity probably depends a lot on when we do it, how we do it, and whom we do it with.\nQuestion of the week\nWhich leads me to the question of the week…\n What are some examples of activities (or work tasks) that energise you? Why do you think these activities energise you?\n What are some examples of activities (or work tasks) that drain you? Why do you think these activities drain you?\nI’d love to hear about your energisers and drainers. If you’re up for sharing your thoughts on this, please reply here.\nAs usual, the form will ask you for your name and email (optional) so that we can give you credit for the story in the book, or potentially reach out to you to ask for more details .\n Answers from last week’s questions\nThanks to all of you who took part in our survey last week where we asked you for ways you make boring work more fun. We read through all your responses and loved them! We wanted to highlight these 3 responses:\nMartje shared this cool hack using spreadsheets:\nFor my PhD I had a mountain of data collection that never seemed to get smaller. So I divided the tasks in 15-60 minute tasks and made an excel spreadsheet. For each task I finished I’d get a point and at the end of each day I’d gain 1-3 percent on my total. Not much but it gave me the motivation to keep going and do extra stuff if I knew I’d get an extra percent.\nBilly shared how choosing to do something really well can help make tasks more enjoyable (this totally resonates with my get to vs have to mindset shift):\nMy tip for making tasks I’d rather not do more enjoyable: I ask myself, what would it look like to do this really well, and what might be the outcome if that’s what I did? For instance: What would make this the best email so-and-so received today?… In my experience, identifying something you don’t want to do and choosing to try to do it extraordinarily well is very satisfying, sacred even, a kind of religious experience.\nAkku shared how the magic triangle of music, games, and friends makes studying for med school more fun\nMusic, Games and Friends These are the 3 broad ways I make studying fun during medical school. (1) Playing soundtrack music helps me focus… (2) You can make something a game by having an element of risk of failure + reward. Using Anki is a great example…(3) Friends can be a superpower if used correctly.\nWe’re looking forward to featuring a few more or your responses next week!\nThat’s it from me for now. Have a great week!\nAli xx"

    ],
    "article_body": "The way we take our notes influences how well we learn. In short, a good note-taking technique is one that helps us remember, retain, and recall the most amount of information.\nClearly, there are a number of different ways we can take notes when learning stuff. Summarising, highlighting, and creating mind maps are just a few of the most popular methods. And to a large extent the ‘correct’ note-taking method is a very personal thing. If you’ve already found a technique that works for you, there’s really little point changing things. Do what works.\nBut, regardless of our preferred method, a good note taking + learning technique should have some easily identifiable characteristics. These essential characteristics are known as the 5 R’s of note taking:\n\nRecord – there should be somewhere to take our notes (obviously).\nReduce – there should be somewhere to summarise those notes.\nRecite – there needs to be an easy way to test ourselves using our notes.\nReflect – our notes should be related to other notes we’ve already written.\nReview – we should regularly revisit our notes to ensure maximum retention.\n\n The 5 R’s\n1. Record\nThe most obvious aspect of any note-taking method is that we need somewhere to actually write our notes.\nWhether we’re sat in a lecture, learning from a textbook, or following an online course (like my Part-Time YouTuber Academy), it’s important to have a blank page to write down all the meaningful points and ideas that you hear/read. Preferably, we should use no more than one piece of A4 paper to do this. Too much information makes it difficult to learn when we review it at a later date.\nMy advice is to use bullet points wherever possible as this helps to organise the notes coherently and helps us to scan for the most important information. Other things I’d suggest are:\n\nUse bold headings when moving on to a new point.\nAim for telegraphic sentences (i.e. brief sentences).\nLeave as much white space as possible on the page to increase readability.\nInclude abbreviations and symbols when writing stuff down. This is one of those seemingly minor note-taking tips that seriously helps when it comes to ramping up our learning speed. (If you’re typing your notes instead, then you may be interested in my video on ‘How I Type Really Fast’).\n\nSource: morksensei.com\n\n2. Reduce\nOnce we’ve written our notes, we need to summarise everything into our own words.\nSummarising is a brilliant way of consolidating our understanding of the information, helps us to see where there are gaps in our knowledge, and there’s even some evidence to suggest it strengthens our memory. At the very least, by condensing our notes we’re essentially stripping away any information that isn’t 100% essential for us to know.\nA lot of people will skip this crucial step thinking I won’t forget this stuff or I’ll just summarise it later, but these thoughts just make our lives so much harder when it comes to revising it later. I find it’s best to summarise everything straight after I’ve learnt it, so the material is still fresh in my mind. But don’t worry if it takes you a day or two to get this step done.\nAnother helpful tip is to reduce our notes by creating a bunch of questions that we can test ourselves on later. These questions should be focused on the main ideas that we’re learning rather than the nitty-gritty details, because the purpose is to ensure we understand the general arguments/points for each topic.\nI talk about this more in my article on Active Recall, but the idea is that self-testing makes revision cognitively demanding as we have to try even harder to retrieve the information we want. This sounds counter-intuitive, but research shows that this helps our brain to better store and recall that same information in the future.\n\n3. Recite\nRecitation involves explaining everything we’ve learnt aloud, in as much detail as possible, without looking at our notes.\nThe process here is similar to the Feynman technique, which encourages us to identify knowledge gaps by explaining a topic as if we’re speaking to a small child. By doing this, we can’t hide from what we don’t know. If we struggle to explain something, we receive instantaneous feedback that we don’t understand the topic well enough. And, therefore, we’ve got to go back to our notes and learn them a little more.\nRecitation is also far more beneficial than passively reading our notes (a common learning strategy for many students). The reason: reciting our notes helps transfer the information more effectively from our short-term memory to our long-term memory.\nIn one study, students were split into two groups and given 7 minutes to read a text. After a short break, the first group was told to repeat the exercise while the second group tried to recall as much information as possible from memory (i.e. recitation). A week later both groups were tested on what they’d learnt. The results were pretty incredible:\n\n40% of the read-only group answered the questions correctly.\n61% of the ‘recitation’ group answered the questions correctly.\n\nPut another way, the simple act of reciting everything we know about a topic helps us to remember and retain more information.\nIf you read anything over twenty times, you will not learn it by heart so easily as if you were to read it only ten, trying to repeat it between whiles, and when memory failed, looking at the book – Francis Bacon\n4. Reflect\nOur brains remember information by associating new knowledge with the stuff we already know. So by reflecting on the things we’ve learnt previously and connecting those facts/ideas/experiences to our most recent notes, we’re giving ourselves the best chance to learn.\nI’ve personally found that reflection is not just a retrospective process. By also reflecting on what we’re going to learn in the future it makes it a lot easier to incorporate and understand that new knowledge when we eventually come to learn it.\nAs a result, I like to reflect in three different ways:\n\nBuild scaffolding – I make a few notes before I start writing my notes to think about what I already know about the topic (i.e. backward thinking reflection).\nMake predictions – I write a sentence about what new knowledge I may learn at some point in the future (i.e. forward thinking reflection). Basically, I make a prediction as to the sort of topics or information that may be relevant and connected to what I’m learning about right now that I haven’t directly learnt about before.\nThe big picture – I try to think about how my notes relate to the big picture (i.e. present thinking reflection). The best way to do this is to write down 2-3 topics that are similar and write down any areas that confused me, which then acts as a springboard for further research and learning.\n\n5. Review\nFinally, we should spend 15 minutes at the end of each day to ‘review’ the notes we’ve written. This is the only reliable way to avoid knowledge decay.\nThe truth is, our knowledge has a half-life. This means that everything we know has an expiration date, and we’ll forget the information we don’t regularly revisit. So scheduling time for distributed review of our notes (i.e. regularly reviewing our notes rather than, let’s say, cramming it the night before a test) better encodes that knowledge into our long-term memory.\nThis is something I talk about in more detail in the following video, so check it out if this sort of stuff interests you:\n\n Implementing the 5 R’s\nNow we know the characteristics of effective note-taking, we need a seamless way of integrating them together into a single strategy. This is where the Cornell Method comes in handy.\nThe Cornell Method of taking notes was created by the director of Cornell University’s ‘Reading &amp; Study Skills Center’, Walter Pauk. In his book, How to Study in College, he says  that the reason we often struggle to take effective notes is because doing so requires work – we need to put in the time to actively engage with what we’re learning about.\nBut this isn’t something that most of us find particularly fun or intuitive.\nLuckily, the Cornell Method is a guided strategy for actively engaging with what we’re learning, by building the 5 R’s of note-taking directly into it.\nThe Cornell Method\nUsing this note-taking method is pretty straightforward. All we have to do is divide a single page of A4 into four sections:\n\nThe right column – this is where we write our main notes from the lecture, video, or textbook. Here we are focused on RECORDING the meaningful points and ideas.\nThe left column – this is where we write down any comments about what we’re learning (like if we agree/disagree) and jot down the key ideas discussed. I also like to use this section to write questions that test the most important pieces of knowledge, then use them as the starting point for RECITING what I remember.\nThe bottom row – at the bottom of the page, we REDUCE our main notes into a few bullet points that summarise everything into our own words.\nThe top row – other than writing the topic (e.g. anatomy) and date (e.g. 25/06/2025), I use the top row to REFLECT on the things I’ve previously learnt. This mainly involves finding 2 or 3 related topics I’ve written using the Cornell Method and listing them in the corner of the page. This helps to create a web of knowledge, which I then use to REVIEW multiple topics.\n\nEventually, we should get something that looks a little like this:\n\n Conclusion\nLearning effectively begins with effective note-taking. And one of the best ways to take effective notes is by using a method that incorporates the 5 R’s.\nFor me, the Cornell Method is the easiest method of doing this.\n\nFirstly, we get a clear, organised, and coherent set of notes.\nSecondly, each section of the page serves a unique purpose, helping us to record, reduce, recite, reflect, or review.\n\nBut, having said that, the Cornell Method is just one of my many strategies I use for learning. If you’re interested in finding out more well-kept secrets on how to study effectively, then I’d love for you to watch my Skillshare class (which you can access for FREE here)."

I’ve just bashed through ~120 psychiatry and obstetrics questions, with around 700 left to get through by tomorrow night.\nA friend of mine got a lovely email from her grandmother giving some advice about the exams. Here’s what it said:\nI’ve been thinking about you for days and wondering how your studying is going and when your exams are. Are you feeling ready? Or just tired and grumpy? It’s such a huge pressure. I do hope you can keep it in perspective – it’s not necessary to be top of the class… you’ll still get to do the type of medicine you want wherever you want… It only matters that you have a family who loves you and dear friends who support you – all unconditionally.\nNo one will ever know, or probably care, how well you do on these exams. It sounds crazy to say, but I think it helps to approach exams as a fun personal game, just seeing what you remember… then, when it’s over, just let it go happy: finished!\nWhile I’ve never been one to ‘stress’ about exams particularly, I’ve found myself thinking about this ‘fun personal game’ tip several times over the past few weeks.\nI still want to do well in the exams, of course, but treating them as a game helps keep them in perspective.\nThose of us lucky enough to be studying Medicine in the UK don’t have much to be worried about when it comes to exams. Our performance in exams contributes around 10% to the overall scores that let us apply for the most competitive jobs in the most competitive areas. And sure, if you’re the sort of person who’s going for an illustrious academic career that requires you to be top of the year and work at specific jobs in Central London teaching hospitals, then it makes sense for you to try and squeeze every last mark out of the exams.\nBut for the rest of us, who may or may not have a clear idea of which career we like, and may not be overly attached to the idea of working in London, treating our medical school exams like a game seems like a pretty healthy way of going about things. It means we work hard and try our best, but hopefully also retain a sense of perspective.\nNo one will ever care about the handful of marks we dropped in a paper by taking the evening off, but we’ll always have fond memories of the lovely night eating sushi and playing board games with friends."

    "category": "Studying",
    "link": [
      "https://aliabdaal.com/how-to-apply-for-a-job/"
    ],
    "article_body": "So you’ve spent hours and hours browsing the internet looking for the perfect job opportunity. Maybe you’ve found it, and you’re wondering how to ace the application – nice one. Or maybe you’re getting frustrated because no good jobs for your skillset are being advertised.\nThis article should help with both scenarios.\nOver the last two years I’ve gone through hundreds if not thousands of job applications, resumes, and cold emails. And I’ve built up an internal list of things I look out for in a job application: potential red flags, but also the things that signal someone could be a great hire.\nSo, in this article I’m going to give you 15 tips for how to apply for a job, even if you don’t follow the standard application process.\n 1. Find the Third Door\nIf your dream job is something traditional like being a doctor or lawyer, it’s kind of obvious what you need to do:\n\nWork really hard at school and university\nFollow the path that’s laid out for you from there (junior positions → senior positions).\nBe generally impressive and do good work.\n\nThere’s no real ‘shortcut’ to success, or a legit way of skipping the queue. You just have to grind. And most people take that approach to every job. They think it’s a grind, where you have to wait in line with your CV and job application.\nBut actually for most jobs there are a bunch of ways to skip the queue, and get a great job ridiculously early in your career. Alex Banayan talks about this in his book The Third Door.\nUsually you do this by making contacts, building interesting things, being active on the right social media… and by cold emailing.\n 2. Learn to Cold Email\nA lot of great jobs, especially if they’re specialised and well-paid, won’t be advertised online like on LinkedIn or Indeed. And if they are advertised, you’ll be competing against hundreds of other people.\nSo my third piece of advice is to always take the initiative. Send a cold email or DM to your potential dream employer without waiting for them to advertise a job. That way, you can skip the queue.\nBut don’t be pushy, or beg for a job. It’s a bit like dating. You don’t DM someone you’ve never met saying ‘would you like to be my girlfriend’: you have to be a bit more subtle. Show you’re interested in working together, make a solid value proposition, then let them make the next move.\nAnd don’t take it personally when someone doesn’t answer. Assume they’re like you: busy, occupied, distracted. So try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.\n 3. Be an opportunist\nThis is how my old Personal Assistant Elizabeth Filips got her job. She simply DM’d me on Instagram, after I said I was looking for a PA.\nShe didn’t get the job because she was insanely qualified: she got it because she had a good vibe, offered value, saw my post on social media, and had the guts to send an opportunistic DM.\nSo, keep tabs on people or companies you’d like to work with (or for) by following them on social media, reading their newsletters. Then you can jump on any job openings, or a CEO saying on Twitter ‘damn, our YouTube thumbnails really aren’t that good’. For really interesting companies, you’re probably doing this already.\nYou want to get inside their head and understand what they like, what they need, and how you can potentially add value.\n 4. Make it Easy to Say Yes\nDo anything that makes it easy for the employer to say ‘yes’ to you. This is lesson 101 on how to apply for a job that isn’t advertised.\nElizabeth did this really well. She said ‘I know you don’t know what you want from this PA thing, and it’s an experiment. But let’s try it for a month. And if you don’t like my services, we don’t have to carry on, no hard feelings.\nAnd I though, okay, cool. This seems very reasonable.\nSo basically, do anything that makes it easier for the employer to say yes to you, so you get your foot in the door. And once you have your foot in the door, perform really well! Now you’ve potentially got a job that’s way more interesting than a random thing you applied for on LinkedIn.\n 5. Build a Portfolio\nIf you want to get a great job, the first step is often to build your portfolio.\nOne way to do this is by getting another job where you get paid to create cool stuff. That will build your skills and portfolio. And then you’ll stand a much better chance of landing your dream job. You’ll also make some decent money.\nThis is what most creative people have to do. Like Johnny Harris, who landed an amazing job working for Vox YouTube channel, writing scripts and doing motion graphics, and now has his own channel with 2.7M subs.\nA great way of getting this kind of experience is by interning or doing a junior role at your dream company. That gives you the opportunity to prove that you fit in and can do a decent job. And when your dream position opens up, the boss can easily promote you without going through a long hiring process to find a new person.\nYou can also build a good portfolio by finding jobs on freelancer websites like Upwork or Fiverr. You might even get some unexpected job offers.\n 6. Shorten Your Resume\nThis is maybe the most standard advice I give when I give advice on how to apply to a job: keep your resume short and sweet, 1 or 2 pages max.\nI can’t emphasise this enough. Focus on the most impressive stuff on your CV and cut the rest. It’s better to have two impressive achievements than two impressive achievements and three weak ones.\nMost people try to stick in every single detail from their life. But unless the job calls for it, no one  cares that you worked behind a bar for 3 years when you were at uni, or that you got a B in your History GCSE.\nMaybe you have loads of experience in various things but it’s not all relevant. Well, there’s no harm having multiple CVs, or tailoring your CV to the job you’re applying for. Send the CV that highlights the most important skills and experience you have for that specific role.\nWhen I look at a clean, 1-page CV with maybe 6 main points on it I feel a sense of relief. It shows the person applying cut out all the unnecessary information.\n 7. Lead with Value\nWith any application, but especially cold emails, you want to lead with value*.* Make it clear what problems you can solve for the business you’re applying to. This is way more interesting to the person reading than a list of your experiences and motivations.\nI get emails every day saying Hi I love your stuff, I think I’d fit in and I have a great skillset, do you think you could offer me a job?. Those emails don’t provide value, or give me a way to judge how good the person really is at their job. So they generally get ignored.\nWrite a super easy to read, play-by-play guide of how you’ll help the company. Then follow it up with a short paragraph about your experience and why you applied. Now you’ve got the perfect cover letter structure.\n 8. Go Above + Beyond\nThe best applications show that the candidate went above and beyond. So I’d suggest that, if possible, you do something for free so you can show your work.\n\nIf it’s a creative job, make something specific: write a YouTube script, edit a video, design a thumbnail. Then include a link in your cover letter.\nIf you’re an accountant, link to a spreadsheet you designed.\nIf you’re a PR person, sketch out an ad campaign you think would work for the brand.\n\nSomeone applying for my writing internship drafted a whole mock issue of my Sunday Snippets newsletter, about dealing with midlife crises. This stuff is gold, and will usually get you an interview.\n 9. Match the Vibe\nMake sure the tone of your cover letter fits how the company usually communicates. If it’s Goldman Sachs, formal is OK. But if you’re applying to work with a young startup, or a media company like mine, keep it more casual.\nStart your email with Dear Ali, Hi Ali, or Dear Ali Abdaal’s team or Hey Ali and team. Or even better, find out which person on the team will be reading your application, and address it to them.\nDon’t write Dear Sir/Madam/to whom it may concern. It gives a weird, formal vibe and shows you haven’t spent more than a minute watching or reading my stuff.\n10. Don’t Bullshit\nThis goes for any type of application, just don’t bullshit. Look at this application for example:\n\nThe person is either bullshitting, or doesn’t understand that they need to give specific examples to back up claims like ‘I am known for inspiring and devising original, thought-provoking concepts’. If you’re a famous philosopher, sure, you can say that. But if you’re a randomer writing a job application, don’t bullshit.\nAlso avoid lots of stilted language like Notwithstanding or ‘to this end, I have endeavoured to further my capabilities, and sentences with loads of adjectives, like The scintillating quality of your phenomenal videos is what prompted my earnest application to your excellent company.\nFinally, no weird cliches like ‘I have a burning passion for education’. This sort of thing makes you sound like a teenager pretending to be an adult.\n 11. Don’t Be Over-Enthusiastic\nWhen some people apply to a job they’re just way too enthusiastic, and it comes across as unprofessional. It’s good to show some enthusiasm, just don’t go overboard.\nThe most extreme examples say stuff like I’m ecstatic to be applying for this role, this is the opportunity of a lifetime, or I feel like I was born to do this job, I will leave my home and family to work with you in London.\nJust mention what you like most about what the business you’re applying to. And be specific so you doesn’t come across as insincere.\nCristian, my editor (aka Zooc on the team chat), finds too much enthusiasm really annoying:\n\n 12. Double-Check Your Spelling\nAt the risk of sounding like a Grammarly ad… check your spelling and grammar super-carefully before sending off your cover letter. Ideally, get someone else to proofread your application.\nIf you make mistakes, it’ll either seem like:\na) you either don’t know how to write properly, or\nb) that you’re sloppy, even with the important stuff.\nWhen you’re applying for a job, even one mistake in a perfect application can raise question marks.\n 13. Create a Video\nYou don’t need to be a videographer and editor to be able to send in a video application. Just record a Loom, or film a video your phone saying hey I’ve made a quick video to accompany my application, here’s what I’d bring to the team.\nIt’s a very quick way of showcasing your personality and standing out from the 1000 other people who applied, and getting the employer to see you as a human being instead of ‘Candidate no.125’. It also shows you really care about the job, and you’re willing to put in some time for your application.\n 14. Do an Amazing Job\nDo your job really well, make solid connections in your industry, and you’ll never need to apply for a job again. That’s because two things will happen:\n\nFirst, you’ll hear through your contacts about random specialised jobs that aren’t advertised anywhere. Like ‘oh I heard YouTuber Matt D’Avella needs a new video editor. And you can contact that person to let them know exactly how you’d solve their problem, potentially landing yourself a job without having to compete with anyone.\nSecondly, and this is how a LOT of people get their dream jobs; that person who has a problem that needs solving might have heard about or seen your work. And they might reach out to you directly.\n\nWord-of-mouth is the best marketing. Once people start to say Timmy (or whatever your name is) is a sick music producer, landing a job will get easier and easier.\n\nThat’s it – my complete guide on how to apply for a job. Follow this advice, work on your skills, and hopefully, you’ll ace your next application."

    "article_body": "I woke up this morning at 6:15 and, as usual, I was pretty groggy and tired. At that point, as usual, the Resistance started whispering to me – You went to the gym yesterday; you should take a rest day and sleep for another hour, you were feeling tired at work yesterday; you should get back into bed and get your beauty sleep, skipping one gym session isn’t going to change anything.\nIt’s remarkably similar to the voice that whispers to all university students – You don’t need to go to that lecture – you’ll just fall asleep anyway, so you might as well stay in bed, You’ll be more productive if you just watch the lecture recording, You don’t feel too good today, how are you going to concentrate in that lecture?.\nThe reason the Resistance whispers in both these situations is that we’re viewing our action as optional. Each day, I’m choosing whether or not to wake up early and go to the gym. Each day, we’re choosing whether or not to turn up to our lectures.\nThe key therefore, is to remove the element of choice: to view going to the gym each day, or turning up to our lectures, as not-optional. After all, we don’t consider it optional to brush our teeth each night (I hope), and those of us tied to wage-slavery certainly don’t consider it optional to turn up to work each day.\nWhen we remove the optionality from the stuff we know we should do, the Resistance disappears and doing it becomes a lot easier. That’s the main reason this blog is still going – each Sunday, it’s not an option for me to write a post and send it to my mailing list, it just has to be done. At the start, we do have to convince our brains of this, but once we’ve put in that cognitive effort a few times, it becomes much easier.\nAlbus Dumbledore once said:\nDark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all face the choice between what is right, and what is easy.\nHarry’s life would’ve been more productive if Dumbledore had told him:\nDark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry. Soon we must all remove the choice between what is right, and what is easy.\nPS: This idea of The Resistance comes from the book The War of Art. If you struggle with procrastination, it’s worth a read. My brother wrote a book review of it that inspired me to start writing my own book reviews."

    "article_body": "You know that feeling when you come across something on the Internet and it immediately resonates with you and you think of 100 different applications for it? Well I had that feeling after reading one of Seth Godin’s daily blog posts this week. Here’s what he says:\nDeadlines work. They work because they focus the mind and create urgency. They work to get us to file our taxes or finish an assignment. They’re an external lever for the work we have to do.\nOn the other hand, dessert works too. You don’t need an external force to encourage you to eat dessert after you’ve finished all your vegetables. It’s something you get to do, not something you have to do.\nYou can build a work life around deadlines. You can procrastinate, pay the late fines and push through the last minute emergencies because you need all of that in order to get to ‘have to’ mode.\nOr, you can follow the path of the most productive and happy people you know. By redefining the work you’ve chosen to do as something you get to do.\nAnd yes, I’ll point out that you can even do that with your taxes. It’s something you get to do because you’re successful and lucky enough to live in a civil society.\nI’m a big fan of how changing the way we talk about stuff changes the way we think about it. In Medicine, we love to complain about how we have to do these discharge summaries, how we have to go through the tedium of our e-portfolio and getting things signed off. Instead, if we internally (and perhaps externally) rephrased it as get to, perhaps our working lives would become more pleasant.\nIn general, I wonder to what extent we can hack our own brains into acting as if doing stuff is a privilege rather than a burden.\nReplying to comments for instance – I could think of it as aargh I have to reply to these hundreds of comments from random people around the world #humblebrag. That wouldn’t be very fun. Instead, I think of it as I get to offer my thoughts to people around the world who somehow found me on the internet and seem to value my advice about their personal issues, this is awesome.\nUltimately, I’m doing the same thing – replying to comments. But in one version of the narrative, it’s a chore. In the other, I’m having a great time. And it’s just that seemingly simple switch from have to to get to that makes the difference."

    ],
    "article_body": "I came across the concept of a Flywheel this week. I read about it on a post called ‘The Flywheel of Wealth’ on the wonderful personal finance blog Get Rich Slowly.\nA flywheel is a mechanical device designed to efficiently store rotational energy. Well, that’s how an engineer would describe a flywheel. I majored in English. To me, a flywheel is a wheel that’s really hard to get started. Once it gets going, however, it’s really hard to stop.\nWhenever we’re starting anything (a blog, a business, a YouTube channel, investing, new healthy habits) the initial work doesn’t lead to much movement. We post a few videos or publish a few blog posts, with only our grandparents as our audience. After a few weeks of this, it’s tempting to think ‘what’s the point’ and quit.\nBut it’s the people who continue to push the flywheel who gain momentum over time. I remember in the first few months of starting my YouTube channel, I’d refresh the app 50 times a day and when the subscriber count would increment by 1 (from 85 to 86) I’d be overjoyed. On some days, I wouldn’t see any growth at all, but I knew (from years consuming of self-improvement books and podcasts) that I had to keep going.\nA friend came over for dinner a few days ago. We were discussing entrepreneurship etc, and he was considering starting a blog to share his experiences of being a part-time DJ whilst in medical school. His main concern was I don’t want to put in a lot of work if it’s not going to go anywhere. When he said that, my eyes lit up, and I told him about this flywheel thing that I’d recently read about. I explained that at the start, he’d be putting in a tone of work and would have absolutely nothing to show for it. But over time, and with consistent effort, the flywheel would start to turn and would change his life.\nI’m not sure he was fully convinced, but I was very pleased because now this flywheel thing is part of my vocabulary, and so functions as a nice mental model and a reminder to be patient and consistent in everything we do.\nPS: I’m trying to be more active on LinkedIn these days. If you fancy sending me a connection request, I’ll accept it  Whatever that means."

      "https://aliabdaal.com/how-to-learn-anything-faster/"
    ],
    "article_body": "Learning how to learn is one of those meta skills that nobody ever really teaches us. But, it’s also the number one skill we should learn if we’re looking to significantly improve our life in basically every single way.\nFor example, when I was in med school, I spent some time learning how to learn. Which meant I could study more efficiently. This gave me more time to do the things I enjoyed, like setting up a business and my YouTube channel.\nThese days, even though I don’t have to sit exams, learning is still a huge part of my life. I’m trying to get better at making videos, learn how to write better articles, and create better systems for managing my team. All of this stuff involves learning.\nSo, in this article I wanted to share nine evidence-based tips that I’ve found really helpful. These work when we’re learning pretty much anything:\n\nSharpen the Axe\nUse Crutches to Optimise Focus\nFind Opportunities for Immersion\nFigure Out Your Weak Links\nTest Yourself\nGet Regular intense feedback\nOverlearn\nUse Spacing\nTeach What You’re Learning\n\n 1. Sharpen the Axe\nGive me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe\nThis is a quote that’s attributed to Abraham Lincoln, and he’s talking about the power of preparation. And when it comes to learning, good preparation is essential.\nLet’s say we’re trying to learn something, like the guitar or a new sport. We should spend a decent amount of time figuring out the meta learning behind what we’re actually going to learn before we do anything else. In other words, we need to work out how we’re actually going to learn the thing – seems obvious but we rarely consider it.\nFor example, when I was learning how to play the piano by ear, I spent a decent amount of time on the ‘Piano Learning’ subreddit, where I could read loads of interesting posts about how to play by ear. And by spending a little bit of time sharpening the axe before I actually sat down to learn the thing, my learning process accelerated.\nIf you’re interested in learning how to learn in a study-related context, I’d highly recommend you read the book Make It Stick – it’s brilliant. Or, you can check out my Skillshare class on evidence-based study techniques.\n 2. Use Crutches to Optimise Focus\nWhenever we’re learning, it’s tempting to do it passively. I sometimes end up watching TV or something while practising the guitar.\nBut, by fully focusing on the thing we’re learning, our brains are able to pick things up much faster. And so I’ve found a few different ‘crutches’ or ‘hacks’ that have been particularly helpful in helping me to focus on what I’m supposed to be learning.\nThe first is the five minute rule. The idea is that if we want to do something and we’re finding it difficult to start, the five minute rule tells us to just work on the thing for 5 minutes. Then, after five minutes, we’re allowed to stop. We don’t have to continue if we don’t want to. But, more often than not, I find that if I’ve already started doing something, I do actually want to continue. The problem was just getting started.\nThe second ‘crutch’ I found useful is to chuck my phone away. I know it sounds simple but we’re so glued to our phones these days that by tossing our phone on the floor or leaving it in the kitchen, we can remove a key point of distraction and force ourselves to focus, free from distraction. And if there’s anything else we find particularly distracting – like tablets, TVs, or other interesting gadgets – it’s really helpful if we can place them as far as possible from our workspace.\n 3. Find Opportunities for Immersion\nThere’s a great book called Ultralearning by Scott Young, where he talks about his journey learning different languages in three months. His takeaway from this experience was that language learning is about immersion. If you can immerse yourself in a language as much as possible, it won’t be long before you’re fluent.\nSo the general principle here is that we learn best when we’re in the environment where we’re actually going to be using the skill.\nFor example, when I was learning how to become a close-up magician, a lot of my early practice was in front of my webcam or a mirror. But, my webcam/mirror wasn’t really the arena where I’d be performing my magic. So I made it a point to try to perform my magic for real people as much as possible. I’d take a deck of cards to school and constantly be showing my friends what I’d recently learnt.\nEventually I got pretty good at performing in front of friends and family, so I started reaching out to do paid gigs. Although, I probably wasn’t good enough to get paid for the magic I knew at the time (). But, that’s not the point. The point was that by performing magic at different gigs and parties, I significantly improved my abilities in a way that wouldn’t have been possible if I stuck to performing in front of the mirror.\nMy advice: step out of your comfort zone and fully immerse yourself in the thing you want to learn. It can be scary, but it’s 100% worth it.\n 4. Figure Out Your Weak Links\nAt Med School I had a few subjects that I was pretty weak in. Like neurology. If you’d asked me what Guillain-Barré syndrome is, I’d have absolutely no idea. I didn’t even know where it would fit into the subject of neurology.\nTip number 4 therefore is to figure out what our weak links are and then focus on drills to improve them.\nWhen it came to studying efficiently for my exams, I knew that I should probably focus on those areas that I don’t know that well. To find out my area of weakness (and, therefore, what I should be studying), I’d constantly ask myself the following questions:\nIf the exam were tomorrow, what topic would I be the least happy about?\nI found this really useful because whenever we’re learning or studying anything, it’s very tempting to just do the stuff that seems familiar to us. If we’re studying for an exam, it’s very tempting to open the book to page one even though we already know that stuff. If we’re learning the guitar, it’s tempting to just play the songs we already know.\nBut, learning only really happens when we’re trying to fix our weaknesses and there’s a decent level of difficulty. If something’s too easy, we’re not going to learn anything.\nSo, if we want to maximise our learning and learn faster, we really want to focus on those areas of weakness. In essence, we need to find the weak links and use drills to improve them as quickly as possible.\n 5. Test Yourself\nIn the world of studying, there’s this thing called ‘active recall’, which applies to learning anything. I have a video about this. And I have a pretty awesome Skillshare course about how to study for exams.\n\nThe idea behind active recall (or retrieval practice) is that we don’t learn by trying to put stuff into our brains. We actually learn, counterintuitively, by trying to take stuff out of our brains.\nAnd if you’ve had that experience where you’ve read something in a textbook or on a website and you’ve completely forgotten everything a few days later, that’s just because you haven’t repeatedly tested yourself on that knowledge (try to recall all 9 of these tips in a few days time to practice!).\nUnfortunately, this word ‘testing’ has many negative connotations. Because we think of testing as a school thing where we’re going to receive a grade and get judged. But, if we move towards thinking of testing as a way to reinforce knowledge and as a strategy for learning, everything becomes easier.\nWithout self-testing we’ll just forget everything we’re trying to learn.\nThat’s why when learning to play the guitar there’s only so many tutorials we can watch before we actually have to start putting it into practice. Or, when we’re studying for exams there’s no point reading the textbook and just summarising what’s in the textbook, we have to actually answer questions and do past-papers.\nThe point is, we have to test ourselves so our brain has a chance to work to retrieve the information. And that’s what really drives learning.\nDesirable Difficulty\nIn the field of learning, there’s this concept called ‘desirable difficulty’. What this means is that we don’t want things we’re trying to learn to be too hard either.\nFor example, if I were trying to play tennis against Roger Federer, it would be way too hard. But, equally, if I were playing tennis against a 10-year-old who hasn’t played tennis before, it wouldn’t be much fun. I probably wouldn’t learn anything. The difficulty is at two different extremes. Neither of which are optimal for learning.\nIdeally, I want to be playing tennis against someone who’s at my level or just a little bit better than me. That’s the arena in which I’ll learn best. And, that’s why having a coach is a good idea. A good coach can moderate their game to be at my level. As a result, I’m more likely to learn as the difficulty is ‘desirable’.\nSo, whatever it is we’re trying to learn, try to apply this concept and make things only slightly harder than our current level. After all, learning isn’t supposed to be easy. It’s supposed to be hard. It’s supposed to be a little uncomfortable. And if it’s hard, then we know we’re doing something right.\n 6. Get Regular Intense Feedback\nFeedback is one of those words that can cause instant anxiety. Especially if we’re starting something and we’re not too sure of our own abilities. Any feedback, constructive or critical, can be a real blow to our ego.\nSo, I think at the start of any learning journey, we need an injection of positivity and enthusiasm, rather than necessarily critical feedback.\nBut, if we do decide to switch gears and start taking our learning super seriously, we ought to avoid reaching for praise and focus on the critical and constructive feedback so we can discover what we need to do in order to improve.\nAgain, this is why having a coach for stuff is actually really, really helpful. Ever since getting a personal trainer, everything in the gym has improved for me: my biceps have gotten bigger () and I’m one-step closer to becoming a Gymshark athlete (). All because I have someone who’s with me giving me feedback on the things that I should do differently.\nBefore I’d probably train once in a blue moon and occasionally ask a friend to check my form. It wasn’t a particularly tight feedback loop. But, now I recognise that it’s these tight feedback loops that encourage learning, whether it’s for exams or for anything else in life.\n 7. Overlearn\nWhen we’re learning something we actually want to try and learn it in more depth than we necessarily need to. And the idea here is to continuously be asking why a thing works the way that it does.\nFor example, most of being a doctor is just following guidelines and a precise set of rules for everything we do. For some doctors, they think that as long as they memorise these guidelines they’re doing their job well. But, for other doctors, they take a first principles approach and actually try to figure out why those guidelines are in place and what the evidence is for following a certain series of rules &amp; regulations.\nIn my experience, it’s hard to say that camp two is objectively a better doctor than camp one. But, certainly the sort of doctor that I want to be is the doctor who understands the stuff from first principles and has made an effort to understand the rationale for doing stuff, rather than just memorising the guidelines.\nThe concept of ‘overlearning’ also applies to learning the guitar. It’s very easy for us to learn a song by following a tutorial. However, the problem with following a tutorial is we’re just training our fingers to go to a particular position. Whereas if we understand music theory, we don’t just know where to put our fingers, we also understand why we’re putting our fingers there.\nSo, although the end result is the same and we play the same thing, we have a deeper appreciation as to why things are the way they are. And it makes learning anything else in that particular sphere so much easier and more efficient.\n 8. Use Spacing\nIn the world of studying, there’s something called spaced repetition.\nBasically, there’s this concept called the ‘forgetting curve’ that was discovered by a guy called Hermann Ebbinghaus in the 1800’s. And the forgetting curve tells us that when we learn something – whether it’s a fact, a skill, or whatever – we’re going to forget it after a certain period of time. In other words, our memory decays over time.\nSo, in order to retain that information, we have to keep testing ourselves on the thing for our brain to absorb the information fully. It’s like with our muscles: if we don’t use our muscles, they’ll atrophy and get smaller (). Equally, with our brains, if we learn a language when we’re five years old and then don’t use it for the next 10 years, we’re going to forget most of it.\nThankfully we can combat the forgetting curve by using this concept of spaced repetition. This applies to learning anything.\nThe idea is that we need to learn the same thing at spaced intervals if we want to encode it into our long-term memory. For example, if I were learning a song on the guitar, I’d practice it on day one, the following day, one month later, and six months later. And by spacing out the practice of this thing, eventually it’s going to become muscle memory. So I won’t need to practice it very much anymore to be able to play it whenever I want.\nIf you want to use spaced repetition in your own learning – especially fact-based learning – there are some great apps you can use. I personally enjoy Anki. It’s an incredible app that completely revolutionised my experience of med school. It does have a bit of a learning curve though, so if you want to give it a go you can check out my Skillshare class, which teaches you some basics along with some advanced tips on how to use the app.\n 9. Teach What You’re Learning\nFinally, teach what you’re trying to learn.\nWe often tell ourselves that we can’t teach someone something because we’re not an expert at it. But, for me, that’s not true. In fact, C.S Lewis talks about this thing called ‘the curse of knowledge’, which is that when we’re trying to learn something, we often don’t learn best from experts. Instead, we learn best from people who are just one step in front of us along the same journey.\nIt’s better to learn from a guide than a guru.\nAnd, certainly for me, I found in med school that my favourite revision sessions or lectures were given by medical students in the year above me rather than the world-class, Nobel prize winning professor. The problem was that the ‘gurus’ (the professors) were old and really far removed from the things I needed at the time, whereas the ‘guides’ (the medical students) knew what level I was at and what I needed to learn next.\nThis is all to say, don’t be afraid to teach what you’re learning.\nWhen I started teaching medical students, and teaching guitar/piano, and teaching YouTube with my part-time YouTuber academy, I found that it really solidified my own knowledge and understanding of that thing. So, as a general policy, whenever I’m learning something I’ll try to document the process. And that helps me to learn it better because I know that I’m possibly going to have to teach this thing a few months/years from now.\n Conclusion\nLearning how to learn is an incredible skill and spending just a couple of hours to understand these concepts can 10X your learning.If you enjoyed this article, I’d highly recommend you check out the books Make it Stick and Ultralearning.

    "article_body": "In a recent podcast, my brother and I discussed the concepts of invisible shackles, the hidden scripts we follow through our lives. We discussed the analogy of The Box (ie: our cultural norms) and how the boundaries of the box limit our thinking. For example, I never imagined that a ‘cycling holiday’ is a thing, until I spoke to friends who go on ‘cycling holidays’ twice a year with their families. They grab their bikes, go to France, and follow a cycle route, stopping off at campsites along the way. That’s awesome.\nLife becomes richer when we expand our box. We can do that firstly, by travelling. Seeing how others live their lives is an effective way of showing us what’s possible, that might be different to what we’re used to, thus expanding our box. We can also expand our box by hanging out with people from different walks of life. But if we’re students or we’ve got jobs, travelling for extended periods of time can be tricky, and it’s surprisingly hard to make time in our daily lives to actively seek out different people.\nI’d like to propose that the easiest ways to expand our box are to (a) read books, and (b) listen to podcasts. Earlier this year, I could never have imagined doing an extended hiking trail, but having spoken to a friend who’s done several, and listened to loads of podcasts with people who regularly hike very long trails, it now seems very possible, and in fact something I’m actively planning to do next year. I’ve expanded my box.\nEqually, the other day I met up with a reader called Jake. He was talking about how he’s been reading a tonne of books and listening to a tonne of podcasts over the past few months, and so he was in the process of starting a personal blog. When he mentioned this to his mum, her response was Why would you start a blog?. Jake was so deeply ingrained in the culture, his box was so expanded that he was baffled by the question – Why wouldn’t you start a blog? It’s just such an obviously good thing to do. The stuff that we consume (our information diet) ends up hugely influencing our world view. We could choose to consume the breaking news, teaching us that the world is a terrible place and bad things happen all the time. Or we could choose to listen to engaging discussions between people doing entirely different things to us. We could expand our box."

    "article_body": "If you’re looking to level up your approach to studying, look no further. In this list, I’ve broken down all of my favourite apps that have helped me over the years, and I’m sure you’ll love them as much as I do.\nFlashcards – Anki, Quizlet\n\nAnki\nThe main flashcard software I use is an app called Anki. Anki is a very powerful flashcard program that allows you to make your own cards or download decks created by other people. Crucially it uses an algorithm built around active recall and spaced repetition and learns as you progress through your studies and revision. I cannot emphasise enough how important active recall and spaced repetition are for studying and so to have it built into this app really is fantastic. Personally, I found Anki particularly useful for two key things:\n1. Firstly, memorising particular facts – for example, as a medical student I used it a lot for pharmacology – learning the names of drugs and what they do.\n2. Secondly, I also used it to help memorise particular paragraphs that I could slot into appropriate essays.\nOne of my friends from university actually switched from making notes in lectures to going straight to making flashcards with Anki and he managed to finish top in our end of year exams. Perhaps one of the downsides of Anki is that it does require more work to create your cards but the spaced repetition algorithm that it uses, which you can customise, is absolutely fantastic.\nQuizlet\nAlthough I have less experience using it, Quizlet is an equally effective flashcard app for using across multiple platforms. One advantage that it can claim to hold over Anki is its superior user interface. It’s really simple to set-up and navigate, allowing you to easily create your own cards or download appropriate ‘decks’ that have been made by other students. The app is used by over 50 million students and teachers worldwide, so you’ll have access to literally millions of sets before you’ve even made your own. The downside is that the app is supported by ads – you can upgrade at a reasonably low cost but it means it’s not entirely free like Anki.\nAs you can see, they each have their pros and cons – I would perhaps try using both and see which one works better for you. Ultimately, they both do very similar things – I preferred Anki, but 50 million students who use Quizlet each month can’t all be wrong.\nNote-Taking – Evernote, OneNote, Notion, Notability\nAlthough evidence suggests that note-taking isn’t the best way to study, we can still derive benefit from taking notes to supplement our revision (which should be based around active recall and spaced repetition). I’ve used a range of note-taking apps during my time as a student and as a doctor, but these are my favourites.\nNotion\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the main reasons I don’t really use OneNote as much anymore is because I found Notion. Notion really changed the note-taking and organisational game for me. It really is a multi-functional and incredibly useful app allowing you to categorise topics, break down subjects into series of toggles and it’s probably become the all-in-one workspace for everything in my life – from planning YouTube videos to organising notes to keeping track of to-do lists – in fact, I’m trying to transform Notion almost into my ‘second brain’. I really cannot speak highly enough of Notion and I’ve done a number of specific videos about how I use Notion which you can find here and here. If there is one app that you decide to download from this list, then make it Notion…\nEvernote\nEvernote has been a really popular resource for a number of years now which means that it’s a developed and trusted note-taking app. It’s packed full of different functions that enable you to consolidate your work in one place as well as categorise different subjects. One other useful feature is the ability to instantly (and easily) search for anything in your notes or files. This might seem simple but so often this is more difficult than it should be with these sorts of apps! Finally, it works across multiple devices which is always helpful and convenient as your information is always with you. Once again, it’s not actually an app that I’ve used extensively but that’s got nothing to do with the quality of Evernote.\nMicrosoft OneNote\nOneNote is often the forgotten sibling of the Microsoft Office applications – it’s often in the shadow of its more well-known relatives – Word, Excel and PowerPoint. But it shouldn’t be. OneNote is a very powerful tool for capturing and organising your notes within an interface which is relatively simple to use. Personally, I relied on OneNote extensively when I was a student in order to keep track of all my handwritten notes which I would scan in and then add to using the infinite horizontal canvas provided by OneNote. If you haven’t checked it out before and you’ve got a Microsoft Account, then it’s definitely worth having a look.\nNotability\nUnlike the previous suggestions, Notability is a handwritten note-taking app. I’ve done a series of videos on how I took notes on an iPad using Notability and I still use the app today for both work-related things as well as planning videos for my YouTube channel or writing down ideas for blog articles like this. If you want a good note-taking app for your tablet, then Notability is certainly the one I’d recommend.\nTo-Do Lists – Todoist\nTodoist\nTodoist is perhaps the most popular task manager in the world. It’s used by over 20 million people and has a range of really simple but highly effective functions built into an interface that is really simple to use. Like the name suggests, you can input to-do lists, plan your day, keep track of deadlines, organise modules and generally keep track of your work all in one place.\n \nRevision Timetables – Google Sheets\nGoogle Sheets\nOnce I began to appreciate the power of spaced repetition and realised that retrospective revision timetables are far superior to the standard timetables most people rely on, I came to rely upon Google Sheets as it provided the perfect platform for a retrospective timetable technique based around spaced repetition. I have discussed more about what this particular system is in this blog post and in this video where I explain why retrospective timetables are highly effective and I preferred using Google Sheets specifically because it gives you access across devices – removing unnecessary friction of having to rely on having the latest software to open certain files. The other major advantage is that it’s free.\nPomodoro Techniques – Focus, Forest\nI’ve actually written a blog post examining this technique (here) and, as I say in that article, ultimately, the Pomodoro technique relies on a timer and so you could use something as simple as a watch to put this technique into practice. However, certain apps have built-in functionality to allow you to work to the Pomodoro rhythm of working for 20 minutes, resting for 5 minutes and repeating that process for four cycles. Below are two apps that I’ve come across in my studies using this method…\nForest\nForest is perhaps superior to other Pomodoro apps because it incorporates both the Pomodoro technique with another means of keeping you focussed and not distracted by your phone – namely, you plant a tree whenever the timer begins and if you go off the app during the 20/25 minute period, the tree dies. It’s an interesting way to help keep you focused through using the Pomodoro technique as well as working on overcoming the distractions emanating from your phone by making sure you stay on the Forest app. I found it helpful and it’s really satisfying to see a forest sort of grow up the more Pomodoros you successfully complete without getting distracted! The only disadvantage – it’ll set you back an eye-watering £1.99\nFocus\nFocus is another app that my friend has used which is simple but effective (and free).\nJournaling – Day One\nYou may be wondering why you’d want to be writing anything else if you’re hard at work revising but there’s actually quite a lot of evidence to suggest that journaling can have some really positive effects. For instance, how simply writing down a small list of things that you are grateful or thankful for each day can do more to boost your personal happiness than increases in salary. When you’re revising, a positive frame of mind is invaluable in reducing the friction of working and, perhaps, might make revision something which is enjoyable…perhaps…certainly I got some benefits from writing my thoughts down on a daily basis. Whilst some people prefer to use a physical journal, the app that I’ve used is…\nDay One\nEasy to use and simple to keep track of your notes. I’ve got a number of different ‘journal streams’ – for instance one recording my daily thoughts and another which records positive comments that I’ve received on YouTube or Instagram for instance. I’ve certainly got some benefits out of keeping track of things in this way so why not give it a go yourself…\nAnd if this was helpful…\nIf you enjoyed my study app lowdown, check out my Apps and Tech pages too."

    "article_body": "Reading is one of the hobbies that I’ve consciously tried to maintain over the past few years. I think a lot of people underestimate how much we can learn from reading – as well as all the other benefits it can offer. I’ve learnt so many valuable lessons from books that I’ve read over the past few years but there are some that I return to regularly, just to remind myself of the golden nuggets of advice that they contain. Below are three books that have perhaps had the greatest impact on my life and my confidence over the past seven or eight years. They have each provided unique insights and lessons that have been incredibly useful and if you look at the ratings that they all have on Amazon, it’s clear that I’m not the only one to have been influenced by them!\n4-Hour Work Week – Escape the 9-5, Live Anywhere and Join the New Rich – Tim Ferriss\nAt first, you might think that this book sounds like a bit of a scam. Quit your job and get rich! But, in reality, it’s far from a scam as its global success proves. The book was originally published in 2006 but has since been re-published and the new editions include testimonies from readers of the original version who took the lessons offered in the first edition and have completely changed their lives.\nSo what it’s about? In essence, the title doesn’t conceal anything. The author talks about his own story and offers tips and advice as to how you can leverage your own qualities and time to change your own life and avoid the treadmill and monotony of office or corporate life. Ferriss outlines how if you want to, you can quit your job and set up a life with automated streams of income by creating a system whereby your businesses are generating you money without you having to do 40-hour weeks. He suggests that we should take the 20 years of retirement and spread them out throughout our life – or, mini-retirements as the author phrases them – where each year you take a few months off whilst running your business remotely and with as little contact time as possible.\nWithin modern society, many people subconsciously travel through life on a treadmill that we’re anxious to step off for fear of ‘falling behind’ – not so much fear of missing out but fear of dropping out. As such, we rarely stop to question where this treadmill is going which is where this metaphor really comes into its’ own – the traditional treadmill of life ultimately goes nowhere – step on it when you go to school and step off it when you retire, perhaps with money in your back pocket but with a body that has been aged by a 30 year career of stress, commutes and worries over falling behind.\nWhat this book is particularly adept at is showing how many people sacrifice their lives to the idea of retirement – Ferriss refers to these people as deferrers – putting off any form of pleasure and enduring a 30/40 year career. He sets this out explicitly and offers an alternative – focussing our attention on the other possibilities and paths that you could take in life which don’t require you to sign up to the 360-480 month subscription of standard office life in the twenty-first century.\nFor me, this was the book that has perhaps singlehandedly enabled me to set up my business which is a company that I set up whilst I was in medical school in 2013 called 6Med. We run courses for medical school applicants, and we made an online bank of questions for those applicants too. That company has been doing really well and I was able to run it alongside studying medicine at Cambridge because of the stuff that I learnt in this book. All the productivity tips and tricks – such as outsourcing to remote workers – have all helped enormously in enabling the company to grow for the past 7 years.\nHere are a couple of quotes that I really liked from the book:\nFor all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. Someday is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you…if it’s important to you and you want to do it ‘eventually’ just do it and correct course along the way\nExcitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase. The question you should be asking isn’t what are my goals? but what would excite me?\nIf you’re confused about life, you’re not alone. There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a problem once you realise that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won\nIn essence, it’s a fantastic book and had a transformative effect on my life. If you have a passing interest in entrepreneurship or just want to get a fresh perspective and critique of the stereotypical 9-5 lifestyle of the modern world then read this book. You can also check out his podcast too – The Tim Ferriss Show – which is always full of interesting advice or interviews.\n\nShow Your Work!: 10 Things Nobody Told You About Getting Discovered – Austin Kleon\nAustin Kleon has written a couple of very popular books – short but packed with incredibly useful and life-changing advice. For me, ‘Show Your Work’ has proven really pivotal to my own life. Before I came across Kleon’s work, I had been toying with the idea of setting up a personal blog for a long time. I wanted to write about some of the lessons that I’ve gained or offer some advice from my own experiences, but I had never been able to get over the fear of self-promotion. I kept having negative thoughts around how people would judge me if I set up a ‘personal blog’.\nIn January 2016, I read Show Your Work and that completely changed the game for me – it made me realise that even if you are not an expert in anything, the fact that you have done anything at all means that you can write about that experience and there will be people somewhere in the world that will find that helpful. For example, setting up a company in Med school – it’s not a very common thing but it’s the sort of thing that people may be interested in so if I just write about my own experiences, I can share the lessons that I’ve learnt and help people.\nThe main idea of this book is that by sharing your work with the world, you are working towards helping people which is going to be an inherent good. The book provides ten rules for being open, generous, brave and productive and it completely changed my perspective and gave me the confidence to overcome that hurdle of fear and start writing. After reading it, I started my own blog which has now developed into what you are reading now. In fact, if it hadn’t been for this book, I probably wouldn’t have set up my YouTube channel LINK because the blog gave me the confidence to ‘show my work’ and overcome that fear that I discussed earlier of self-promotion and narcissism. It made me comfortable with the idea of putting myself out there.\nI’ve now had thousands of messages from people all over the world who have been inspired or have learned something from the content that I’ve put out and the work that I’ve shared. If it hadn’t been for this book that I read in 2016, perhaps none of this would’ve happened and I wouldn’t have been able to help those people.\nIf you make any kind of content or would like to make content then this would be a really valuable book to read. We all have something to contribute – teach what you know and try to share something small everyday.\n \nAnything You Want: 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur – Derek Sivers\n \nAlthough this book has ‘entrepreneur’ in the title, please don’t let this put you off. The lessons that Sivers offers are as much lessons for life as they are for business and can be applied universally. I think anyone could gain quite a lot from reading this book and it certainly had an enormous impact on my own life.\nAs a bit of background, Derek Sivers was an independent musician who wanted to sell his CDs online in the mid 1990s but there wasn’t a platform that would do this at this point in time before the internet really took off. As a result, he decided to set up a company called CD Baby with just $500 in 1998 to help himself as well as other musicians to sell their music through the internet. He hired his first employee in 2000, grew the company to one that employed 85 people and was making over $100 million in revenue. He lists a number of lessons that he learnt from this business including:\no Invent and Improve\no Stop Things That Don’t Work\no Execution is Key\no Focus on Today\no Care About Customers\no Little Details Are Important\no Trust and Delegate\nThe company was sold for $22 million in 2008 but before he decided to sell the company, he transferred ownership to a charitable trust which then sold the company on his behalf – only 5% of the sale went to Sivers with the remainder of the money going to a charity for musical education.\nThis act was in keeping with Sivers’ overriding philosophy of generosity. This philosophy underlies much of what Sivers discusses in the book and the other key message is that you don’t need a visionary master plan to build a business – you should concentrate on what makes you happy and be guided by a philosophy of ‘having enough’.\nWe might think that the idea of not constantly chasing growth is quite novel in a world where every start-up just seems intent on gaining traction as fast as possible, growing as fast as possible, making money as fast as possible – ultimately aiming for growth at all costs. But Sivers ascribes to a different philosophical approach – pursue hobbies, businesses, side-hustles if they make you happy.\nThe book had a particularly profound effect on me in 2016. I had been running my company, 6Med, for about three years and it had been going well – growing year-on-year, increasing revenues, gaining more students. But in early to mid 2016 our growth started to stagnate and even dip slightly. I’d never really experienced anything like that before – suddenly something that had been going so well was on the decline and this caused me to question and doubt myself. Why has this suddenly stopped growing? What have I done? What have I done wrong? But then I came across this book and one quote in particular really struck a cord with me:\nNever forget why you’re really doing what you’re doing. Are you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn’t that enough?\nI regularly return to this quote to keep things in perspective. I can sometimes end up in a spiral whereby anytime I’m not working I feel guilty that I’m not generating content or keeping across my subscriber numbers. But I know that I’m immensely lucky to have the company, the YouTube channel, this blog and everything that that has brought with it. Whenever I find myself thinking that ‘I should make another video because my ad revenues have dropped’ or something along those lines, I open this book and read that quote. It reminds me that the revenue isn’t important – I’m enjoying what I’m doing, I’ve got amazing things on the side of my full time job and I’m helping people. Isn’t that enough?\nBusiness is not about money. It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself. The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so only do what makes you happy and isn’t that the best sentiment to end this post on?\n\nLinks to books:\nThe 4-Hour Work Week\nAnything You Want\nShow Your Work!"

    "article_body": "Hey friends,\nSo now that my team and I are taking this website more seriously, and now that I’ve decided that being a writer is a dream of mine, I’m starting this public journal.\nI do a reasonable amount of writing privately (thanks to Morning Pages, Roam Research and the Day One app), but one of my life philosophies is that everything is better when it’s public.\nAnd so, I’m going to make an active effort to write on this section of the blog more often. I won’t overthink it – I’ll just write stuff into Ghost and I’ll hit the publish button, and maybe share it on Twitter if I feel like it.\nIn a strange way, there’s something very liberating about having a public blog. It’s almost like Twitter (but a bit more long-form), and almost like Instagram stories (but a bit more long-form). It’s a place where I can write literally whatever the hell I want, and if people want to read it, they can read it. And even if no one reads it, the act of writing and publishing is valuable anyway.\nThis feels particularly liberating because in the past, I’ve thought of this website as a serious place for serious blog posts only. Obviously, to publish anything on here, it needs to be SEO keyword-researched and needs to actually be valuable, and have a clickbait title, and have a perfectly formatted cover image etc. And my YouTube channel is a stage worse. When the audience was small, I felt free to post random shit on there and not care about its quality. These days, I care a lot, and anytime I post a video that doesn’t perform well, I enter a spiral of subclinical depression.\nBut with a public journal, there’s none of that pressure. I can just type away, hit publish and not worry about quality. This is what dreams are made of.\n The Surge of Inspiration\nI’m writing this post sitting on the armchair in my living room at 10:30pm. In fact, why not – here’s a cheeky photo.\n\nWhat’s prompted me to write this post at night? Well, it was a surge of inspiration from getting off a coaching call with Matthew Dicks. Matthew is one of my favourite authors, and wrote the book Storyworthy which was my favourite non-fiction book of 2020.\nI emailed him a few months ago asking if he would be my storytelling coach. I knew I wanted to become a better storyteller, and now that my YouTube channel makes decent amounts of money, I’m in the glorious position where I can literally pay people to teach me stuff.\nAnyway, our first couple of sessions were focused around storytelling, and Matthew gave some excellent advice, and feedback on my own stories. But pretty quickly, the sessions turned into a combination of therapy + brainstorming + general chit-chat. Both Matthew and I are huge productivity nerds (he’s also, like me, writing a book about the topic). He’s a fair bit older than I am, but I feel we’ve generally approached life in a similar way, and so the conversations are always invigorating (at least for me).\nIn our session earlier today, I asked Matthew to what extent do you set goals?. He laughed and said that’s funny, because I’m huge on setting goals, and in fact, I write a blog post every month where I update my readers about my goals.\nHe then dropped the bomb that I’d been completely unaware of – that he’s been blogging every day since 2003.\nI’ll let that sink in. He’s been writing a blog post. Every single day. Since 2003.\nIt helps him think, it helps him figure out what his ideas are, and it’s a great way to journal in public. He spends around 30 minutes writing the post each morning. He often starts by writing I’ve been thinking about… or I recently read… and lets the ideas flow from there.\nHearing this was hugely inspiring, and gave me the surge of energy that’s led me here typing this out straight into my website’s text editor.\n Le Plan\nDo I want to try to blog every day? Nah probably not. I feel I’ve got a lot on my plate right now, and I don’t want to have yet another thing that I feel compelled to do even when I don’t feel like it.\nBut it’ll certainly nice to have this as a place to publicly journal whenever I do feel like it.\nHave a wonderful day."

    "article_body": "Alright, I’m going to start (trying) to do this as a monthly thing. How hard can it be? Hat tip to Matthew Dicks for the inspiration. This post is probably a lot longer than most of the future posts will be, because this is the first time I’m writing a lot of this stuff down. So time for my 2021 goals report update\n Get six pack abs\nI was semi-serious about this goal in January, but in February I decided that I couldn’t be bothered with the calorie deficit. I still think it would be nice to do at some point, but with lots of other big projects going on in my life + a generally sedentary lifestyle, I felt that it wasn’t the right time to really take this seriously. Oh well.\nI’m making an effort to generally eat a little healthier, and experiment with intermittent fasting. And I’m keeping track of my body measurements + occasionally taking progress photos. Part of me hopes that the six-pack abs will magically happen if I sort my diet and lifestyle enough, but that’s probably unrealistic.\n\n Fix my posture\nI have a serious issue with anterior pelvic tilt + nerd neck + rounded shoulders. My bum sticks out like a Kardashian, and not in a good way. This is thanks to decades of sitting on a desk in front of a computer.\nI’ve been half-arsing this particular goal. Other than spending around 30% of my desk time in standing mode, I haven’t made much progress towards fixing my posture. I know it involves daily stretching and strengthening exercises (hip flexor stretches, glute bridges etc) but I haven’t yet built the habit.\nAction Point – Find a default stretching and mobility routine that I can do while watching TV or while standing at my desk in Zoom calls.\n Get more hench\nThis is going well. I’ve been doing 3/week Zoom sessions with my personal trainer, and he works me quite hard with my home workout stuff – pullup bar, 16kg kettlebell, exercise bands, weighted vest. For the past few months, I’ve been getting consistent comments on YouTube videos + Instagram that my biceps are looking better. My housemate even comments this sometimes. It’s a nice feeling. Let’s keep going with it.\n\n Live longer and healthier\nNot going great. Partly becuase I hadn’t written this down as a goal before today. I’m reading Fast this Way by Dave Asprey, which is giving me an introduction to the world of intermittent and other types of fasting, which are apparently good for longevity.\nI need to do more reading around the 80/20 of things I should cut out from my diet and lifestyle – I suspect I’m eating quite a lot in the way of inflammatory foods, artificial sugars, low-quality fats etc. Right now, I know that some of these are Bad but I don’t know how Bad they are and what the evidence for their Badness is.\nMaybe this would be a good blog post + video to research this month.\nAction Point – Ask my team to research a video around How to Live Longer and Healthier or something like that.\nHappiness\n Do more journaling\nJournaling is apparently good for one’s health and wellbeing. I’ve been dabbling in it through Morning Pages, but I want to take it more seriously moving forward. This public journal feels like a good way of going about that.\n Be more grateful\nIn my live-streamed interview with Justin Kan (co-founder of Twitch), we talked about various strategies for wellness. Justin’s favourite is Gratitude Journaling – each morning, he writes down 3 things that he’s grateful for. This is a ridiculously simple practise, and I’ve been hearing about it on the grapevine for years – apparently there’s some evidence that it does more to boost your happiness than a doubling of your salary.\nEither way, after hearing him wax lyrical about it, I decided to give it a go. I’ll report back next month.\nAction Point – Gratitude Journal everyday, and include screenshots in next month’s Goals Report.\nMajor Projects\n Write a Really Good Book\nThis is making some progress. Here’s an update video.\n\nI’m on the verge of officially signing with a literary agent, and I’m working with David Moldawer to help whip the book proposal into shape before we try to get a US publishing deal.\nI really want the book to become a NYT bestseller. But this is a tricky goal because (a) it’s really hard to do, and (b) I don’t like having goals that are outside of my control.\nRemember to join my Book Journey mailing list if you want updates \nMedicine\n Work part-time in A&amp;E\nWhen I think about my long-term goals regarding Medicine, I keep landing on the idea of working part-time. I think working 2 days a week as a doctor might be quite fun. The speciality I’m leaning towards is Emergency Medicine. This means I’d be spending most of my time in A&amp;E (Accident &amp; Emergency), otherwise known as ER (the Emergency Room).\nI had a chat with one of the A&amp;E consultants (the UK version of Attendings) at my local hospital, and he kindly invited me to join the AE&amp; Locum Bank. Locums are extra shifts you can pick up here and there.\nGiven that I’ve never really had proper experience in A&amp;E, I want to try it out for a few months to see if I like the vibe of Emergency Medicine. And I want to test the assumption that working 2 days a week would be fun.\nThe annoying thing is that for the past month, I’ve been going back and forth with the Medical Staffing department to try and get the paperwork sorted out. Currently, my DBS (criminal records) check is processing, and that seems to be what’s holding things up.\nOnce the paperwork is sorted, I’ll pickup a few shifts and see how things go \n Become a Medical Educator\nI enjoy teaching Medicine much more than actually practising it. My mid- to long-term goal is to get some sort of flexible teaching position at a medical school so I can teach people in real life, when the pandemic stops. From 2019-2020, I was a physiology supervisor at Girton College, Cambridge, which was super fun. I quit the post in August 2020, intending to travel the world, but the pandemic put a stop to that, and so I haven’t done much in the way of medical education for the past few months.\nNot sure I can be bothered with doing Zoom teaching sessions, so I think we’ll park this particular goal until real-life teaching opens up again.\n The Medicine Bucket List\n\nWork in different countries – I’d love to try my hand at working in Emergency Medicine in different countries. Step 1 is to get reasonably good at it, probably starting off in the UK. Step 2 is to explore other cool places to travel to where I can be useful. I like the idea of Australia / New Zealand / South Africa.\nDoctors without Borders – I love the idea of doing humanitarian medical stuff. The book War Doctor by David Nott really inspired me last year. This is a very long-term plan because generally, to be useful in these environments, you have to know what you’re doing (whereas I’ll be in training for at least the next 5 years).\n\nLearning Cool Stuff\n Become a Concept Artist\nThis is going well. I’ve been having Zoom art lessons 2-3 times per week with Alessandro Pirrelli. They’ve been quite fun. I don’t do any practise at all outside the sessions, which is probably Bad, but oh well.\n\n Join the Magic Circle\nIn an attempt to increase my sexual market value, I’ve been dabbling in close-up magic since 2011. When I was at university, I used to perform at end-of year balls and parties. Since I’ve graduated, I haven’t taken magic particularly seriously.\nBut then, a few weeks ago when a chap called Matthew Le Mottée emailed me. He’s a professional magician based in Cambridge, an Associate of the Inner Magic Circle, and has won the Magic Circle Close-Up Magician of the Year competition 3 times. This is a huge deal in the world of magic.\nIn return for free access to my Part-Time YouTuber Academy, he’s become my Magic Mentor, and we’re working on getting me into the Magic Circle. This involves building a 8-12 minute magic act to perform in an audition to other members of the Magic Circle + judges.\nWe’ve just started figuring out what routines I might do during the act, and brainstorming ideas for incorporating storytelling elements into it. It’s been quite fun so far.\n Learn to Freestyle Rap\nIn February 2021, I started a 30-day experiment to try and learn to freestyle rap. After seeing the likes of Chris Turner and Harry Mack on YouTube, I thought this is really cool and decided I wanted to learn it.\nSo over the past few weeks, I’ve been having lessons with my friend Michael from Ultraspeaking. It’s going alright, but it’s quite hard. I’m working on a video that shows the journey in more detail.\n Busk on the London Underground\nThis has been on my bucket list for a few years. There’s a few action steps:\n\nAudition for a license (yes, you need to audition to be legit enough to get a license for the London Underground). This is stalled because of the pandemic.\nBuild a set list of 15 songs that I can sing on repeat – I’ve got around 12. Need to work on some more.\n\nLife + Relationships\n Take Dating more seriously\nNot going well at all. I’d like to think this is mostly because of the lockdown situation. I’ve tried out a few Zoom dates, which have been alright, but they aren’t really a substitute for the real thing. It feels a tad pointless to be chatting on the phone to someone who I might not meet for several months.\nSo until lockdown is properly lifted, I might just put this on the back burner.\n Make more of an effort to stay in touch with friends\nGoing reasonably well. I’ve been having occasional phone calls with friends more often than I used to. Still plenty of room for improvement.\nBusiness Stuff\n Take this website more seriously\nThis is going well. We’ve just done a radical redesign, and the fact that I’m writing this shows that I’m taking this website more seriously. We’ve got 2 new people on the team (Gareth and Jakub) who’re helping out with website writing + SEO. They’re very good.\nWe even hit the front page of Hacker News with our recent The Art of Reading article, which was nice (that’s the spike in traffic down below).\n\n Keep the YouTube channel ticking along\nGoing well. We’ve dropped down to 2 videos per week, which feels much more manageable than the 3 per week we were shooting for, especially as writing the book is the highest leverage thing I could be doing at this point, and so I wanted to have some free time and mental space for that.\n\n Take my Second Channel more seriously\nMy second channel was meant to be a medical educational resource, but in early 2020, I lost motivation in that particular goal. So the channel’s been dormant for a while, but we’re in the process of reviving it.\nWe want the second channel to be a destination for shorter clips, repurposed from podcasts and interviews that I do. It’ll also be nice to be able to do live streams, Q&amp;As, and other random videos without having to worry about the algorithm and performance on the main channel.\nHopefully more progress on this front this month.\n Grow the podcast – Not Overthinking\nThis is going well. We’ve had a podcast YouTube channel for a few months, but we started taking it seriously over the past few weeks. We now film all our podcasts using Riverside, and upload full episodes + clips to the YouTube channel. The YouTube channel is a great source of growth and discovery for the podcast.\n\n\n Grow the Mailing List\nWe’ve rebranded my email newsletter as the Friendzone. And we’re in the process of switching from Revue over to Convertkit as our email provider. The challenge now is to figure out ways to grow the mailing list in a wholesome and non-spammy way. We’ve got a few ideas on that front (lead magnets and the like). I’ll report back next month.\nAction Point – Migrate from Revue to Convertkit and figure out an email list building strategy.\n Grow on Instagram\nWe’re doing a decent job of growing on Instagram. My team handles the repurposed content side of things, and I post random pics of myself here and there that seem to perform quite well. We’re thinking about how to use Reels a bit more. But overall, things going well. Which is nice, because growth on Instagram isn’t something I particularly care about personally.\n\n Keep Twitter ticking along\nI don’t really think too hard about my Twitter account. My team is doing a good job of posting short clips repurposed from podcasts and interviews. And I just tweet stuff whenever I feel like it. Here are some analytics from Ilo.\n\nKinda funny how my highest impression tweet (by a long way) was a random screenshot posted as a spur of the moment thing.\n\nmy man @JamesClear continuing to crush it on the daily  pic.twitter.com/sNRCm9XTzA\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) February 26, 2021\n\nAnd my highest engagement tweet was a classic Fortune Cookie format.\n\nSuccess isn’t about getting more done, it’s about having more fun.\nIf you’re having fun, productivity takes care of itself.\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) February 26, 2021\n\n Dabble with TikTok\nWe haven’t quite figured out what our TikTok strategy’s going to be, but we’re producing lots of &lt;60 second content for YouTube shorts and instagram, so we’re thinking about how we can chuck it on Tiktok as well.\nMy friend Omar (School of Scent) grew ridiculously huge on Tiktok (250k followers!), and his audience there is migrating over to his YouTube channel. This would be a nice thing to emulate.\n Dabble with Facebook Video\nWe’ve seen a lot of other creators (Doctor Mike, Jay Shetty etc) have success with Facebook video. Again, because we’re producing tonnes of video content already, we’re thinking about how we can distribute it on Facebook as well to reach a different audience.\n\nSo that’s it. This post is a hell of a lot longer than I thought it would be, but if you’ve read this far, I hope you’ve found it vaguley interesting.\nI’d love for you to join the Friendzone below if you want an email with the next post in the series."

    "article_body": "Here’s a link to last month’s goal report that had more details about each of these.\nHealth\n Get six pack abs\nI abandoned this goal last month. I’m still attempting to eat broadly healthily, but getting takeaways far too often. Most days I’ve been intermittent fasting (ie: skipping breakfast) upon Dave Asprey’s advice in the book Fast This Way.\n Fix my posture\nI have a serious issue with anterior pelvic tilt + nerd neck + rounded shoulders. My bum sticks out like a Kardashian, and not in a good way. This is thanks to decades of sitting on a desk in front of a computer.\nI’ve been half-arsing this particular goal. Other than spending around 30% of my desk time in standing mode, I haven’t made much progress towards fixing my posture. I know it involves daily stretching and strengthening exercises (hip flexor stretches, glute bridges etc) but I haven’t yet built the habit.\nMar 2021 Action Point – Find a default stretching and mobility routine that I can do while watching TV or while standing at my desk in Zoom calls.\nUpdate – Someone DMd me on Instagram after reading last month’s post, and pointed me towards this video by Jeff Nippard. It made me question my goal of ‘fix my posture’ and made me wonder if maybe it’s not all bad. Given the abundance of conflicting information on the internet, I should ask my personal trainer about this.\n\nApr 2021 Action Point – Ask my personal trainer about whether I need to ‘fix’ my posture and if so, how to go about it.\n Get more hench\nNo changes to report since last month. The YouTube comments of ‘your biceps are getting bigger’ have fallen in frequency sadly. I’ve also dropped down to 2 Zoom sessions per week with my personal trainer, which feels more generally sustainable. And thanks to the UK lockdown rules loosening a little, I’ve restarted tennis lessons, which should hopefully contribute to some level of calorie burn / cardiovascular health.\n Live longer and healthier\nStill not going well.\nI need to do more reading around the 80/20 of things I should cut out from my diet and lifestyle – I suspect I’m eating quite a lot in the way of inflammatory foods, artificial sugars, low-quality fats etc. Right now, I know that some of these are Bad but I don’t know how Bad they are and what the evidence for their Badness is. Maybe this would be a good blog post + video to research this month.\nMar 2021 Action Point – Ask my team to research a video around How to Live Longer and Healthier or something like that.\nApr 2021 Update – Completely forgot that this was a thing. I’ve now asked my team about it so we’ll see what happens.\nHappiness\n Do more journaling\nJournaling is apparently good for one’s health and wellbeing. I’ve been enjoying doing Morning Pages most mornings. It’s brought me some level of mental clarity. I normally write a few dozen to a few hundred words in Roam, and then every so often I copy and paste them into Day One, the journaling app I’ve been using for years.\n\n Be more grateful\nIn my live-streamed interview with Justin Kan (co-founder of Twitch), we talked about various strategies for wellness. Justin’s favourite is Gratitude Journaling – each morning, he writes down 3 things that he’s grateful for. This is a ridiculously simple practise, and I’ve been hearing about it on the grapevine for years – apparently there’s some evidence that it does more to boost your happiness than a doubling of your salary.\nEither way, after hearing him wax lyrical about it, I decided to give it a go. I’ll report back next month.\nAction Point – Gratitude Journal everyday, and include screenshots in next month’s Goals Report.\nApr 2021 Update – I’ve been doing this occasionally. As part of my Roam daily note template, where I have my Morning Pages prompt, I have a gratitude section that I sometimes fill in. Here are some examples.\n\nI don’t feel like this has made a meaningful difference to my happiness, but it’s a nice thing to do each morning.\nMajor Projects\n Write a Really Good Book\nMar 2021 – I’m on the verge of officially signing with a literary agent, and I’m working with David Moldawer to help whip the book proposal into shape before we try to get a US publishing deal.\nI really want the book to become a NYT bestseller. But this is a tricky goal because (a) it’s really hard to do, and (b) I don’t like having goals that are outside of my control.\nApr 2021 Update – I’ve now signed with a literary agent (Kate Evans from Peters Fraser Dunlop). She’s great.\nAnd while it would be nice to shoot for the NYT list, and I’ll do whatever I can on the marketing front to increase the odds of that happening, it’s far more important for me to write a book that I’m happy with. So whenever I think about the book goals, I try and remind myself of the internal goal (writing a book I love) rather than the external one (becoming a bestseller).\nRemember to join my Book Journey mailing list if you want updates \nMedicine\n Work part-time in A&amp;E\n\nI’m still waiting for my paperwork to be processed because I can go back to work. The plan is to work a few days each week in the Emergency Department of my local hospital. Hopefully, fingers crossed, things get sorted out in the next few weeks so I’ll have more of an update next month.\n Become a Medical Educator\nI enjoy teaching Medicine much more than actually practising it. My mid- to long-term goal is to get some sort of flexible teaching position at a medical school so I can teach people in real life, when the pandemic stops. From 2019-2020, I was a physiology supervisor at Girton College, Cambridge, which was super fun. I quit the post in August 2020, intending to travel the world, but the pandemic put a stop to that, and so I haven’t done much in the way of medical education for the past few months.\nNot sure I can be bothered with doing Zoom teaching sessions, so I think we’ll park this particular goal until real-life teaching opens up again.\n The Medicine Bucket List\n\nWork in different countries – I’d love to try my hand at working in Emergency Medicine in different countries. Step 1 is to get reasonably good at it, probably starting off in the UK. Step 2 is to explore other cool places to travel to where I can be useful.

This is a very long-term plan because generally, to be useful in these environments, you have to know what you’re doing (whereas I’ll be in training for at least the next 5 years).\n\nLearning Cool Stuff\n Become a Concept Artist\nI’m still taking art lessons over Zoom 2-3 times per week. But things have been slower this month because my art teacher and I have mostly spent our time discussing an exciting new project we’re working on together, rather than actually doing art. Oh well.\n Join the Magic Circle\nBackground – In an attempt to increase my sexual market value, I’ve been dabbling in close-up magic since 2011. When I was at university, I used to perform at end-of year balls and parties. Since I’ve graduated, I haven’t taken magic particularly seriously.\nBut then, a few weeks ago when a chap called Matthew Le Mottée emailed me.

It’s been quite fun so far.\nApr 2021 Update – Lessons going well. I ordered a really nice set of Cups and Balls from Brett Sherwood, which arrived a few days ago. Here’s a quick TikTok I made practising some moves.\n\n@aliabdaal I need a wizard name. Please comment suggestions #magic #magician #harrypotter #wizard  Hedwig’s Theme – John Williams\n\n\n Learn to Freestyle Rap \nIn February 2021, I started a 30-day experiment to try and learn to freestyle rap. After seeing the likes of Chris Turner and Harry Mack on YouTube, I thought this is really cool and decided I wanted to learn it. Here’s a video showing my journey.\n\nI think I’m going to abandon this as a goal now that I’ve ticked it off. Freestyle rap is fun, but it’s not something I particularly care to practise and actively improve at.\n Busk on the London Underground\nThis has been on my bucket list for a few years. There’s a few action steps:\n\nAudition for a license (yes, you need to audition to be legit enough to get a license for the London Underground). This is stalled because of the pandemic.\nBuild a set list of 15 songs that I can sing on repeat – I’ve got around 12. Need to work on some more.\n\nLife + Relationships\n Take Dating more seriously\nMy brother and I had a really interesting conversation with Joey Savoie on our podcast, Not Overthinking. Here’s a clip that relates to dating that changed the way I approach one aspect of it.\n\n Make more of an effort to stay in touch with friends\nGoing reasonably well. I’ve been having occasional phone calls with friends more often than I used to. Still plenty of room for improvement.\nBusiness Stuff\n\nThis website – Going well. We’ve got some decent articles on here, and we’ve been working to sort out all the various errors that have accumulated over the past 5 years.\nMain channel – Ticking along.\nSecond channel – Hasn’t quite started ticking along, but should hopefully start to tick this month.\nPart-Time YouTuber Academy – We wrapped up Cohort 2 of the course. It was super fun. Might write a retrospective about it later if I feel like it.\nMailing List – Switched over to ConvertKit, ticking along. Rebranded to the Friendzone.\nTikTok – We started taking this seriously a few weeks ago, and the account’s on 11k followers now!\nInstagram – Ticking along.\nTwitter – Ticking along.\n\nOverall Plan for the Month\nNow that we’ve wrapped up the second cohort of the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, I’ve got more spare time on my hands to focus on book-writing. We’re aiming to have the proposal done and dusted by the end of May, so 2 more months of continuing to thrash around with a tonne of ideas and trying to figure out what the underlying thread through the book is going to be.\nThanks for reading!"

    "article_body": "How NOT To Study for Exams\n\nRereading The Futility of Rereading\nHighlighting Textbooks Aren’t Colouring Books\nBad Notetaking When Extra Work Doesn’t Produce Better Results\n\nWhen was the last time you were taught how to study? We have lessons on a whole a range of subjects but we rarely, if ever, see ‘Studying’ as a subject on our timetable. Yes, we might get snippets of advice from teachers about best practices but we’re never formally taught. It’s assumed that we’ll pick up the random tips that we receive and develop our own strategies.\nTo some extent, this is rational. Revision is personal. How we revise, the techniques we use and the time we spend trying to study varies from person to person. However, despite these variations, we all drift towards certain common techniques that feel intuitively helpful and productive including strategies such as rereading, highlighting and summarising.\nBut we’ve got it all wrong.\nDespite their popularity, studies have shown that these techniques don’t consistently boost our performance. This paper from 2013 by Professor Dunlosky analysed hundreds of studies relating to revision technique and showed that these three popular techniques all have ‘low utility’ when compared to other approaches.\nAnd so, it’s only right that we begin this ultimate guide by explaining how NOT to study before moving on to the key steps necessary for efficient and effective studying practice.\n1. Rereading\nWe all love re-reading. It feels super productive doesn’t it?\nRereading is the most popular technique that students rely upon to revise. It’s straightforward and gives us the sweet inner satisfaction that we’re engaging in some form of study.\nBut rereading is passive.\nOur brains are most effective at retaining information when it’s being actively used.  and research suggests that rereading is neither a productive nor efficient form of studying.\nDunlosky and his colleagues concluded that rereading notes or textbooks has ‘low utility’. Whilst it can improve some very short-term retention, in comparison to other techniques it’s far less effective as a long term strategy for retaining information.\nIn essence, despite the vast majority of us relying on rereading as a technique to enhance our revision, it’s ineffective and inefficient when compared with other techniques.\n2. Highlighting\nA second popular technique is highlighting. Once again, evidence suggests that highlighting is a particularly popular revision strategy; it’s active, feels productive and even allows our creative tendencies to (over)flow into making our notes look colourful.\nBut if we go back to the meta-study conducted by Professor Dunlosky, they rated highlighting as having low utility too; simply providing what Dunlosky called a safety blanket.\nIn fact, for higher-level tasks that require inference making, highlighting may actually hurt performance. This is especially important given that many subjects  at A-Level and university require some degree of making inferences. As such, highlighting could be hindering our performance at the latter stages of our education.\n3. Summarising / Making Notes\nSummarising and making notes has great appeal too as a means of making our revision feel more productive. Whilst evidence is more equivocal in this case and the quality of notes varies between students, Professor Dunlosky and his colleagues concluded that:\nOn the basis of the available evidence, we rate summarization as low utility. It can be an effective learning strategy for learners who are already skilled at summarizing; however, many learners (including children, high school students, and even some undergraduates) will require extensive training, which makes this strategy less feasible.\nIn essence, if you know how to effectively summarise and make notes it can be useful but we’re rarely, if ever, taught or trained to make notes effectively. And even if you are particularly adept at note-taking, the technique still falls around the middle of the pack compared to other revision techniques.\nThe conclusion we should draw is that: Making notes is far less effective than we perhaps convince ourselves that it can be.\nThis isn’t to say that making notes is a complete waste of time. It can sometimes make revision enjoyable if you like using colours or calligraphy. But we shouldn’t fool ourselves into thinking that it’s one of the more effective revision techniques; just because we’re writing things down, doesn’t mean we’re making the best use of our revision time.\n\nHow To Actually Study For Exams\nIf rereading, highlighting and summarising aren’t effective methods of revising, then what should we be doing? The two most effective methods are active recall and spaced repetition which, in combination, will help make your studies more efficient, effective and rewarding. I’ll cover both of them as part of this Ultimate Study Guide but please do check out the videos I made [here] and [here] which look at each in more depth. However, although they are the key components, there are plenty of other elements necessary for an effective, efficient and successful study routine and they can all be grouped into four key parts – Understand, Remember, Plan and Focus.\n\nHow To Actually Study For Exams – Understand\nActive Recall Theory and Evidence\nWe often think that we can only start testing ourselves after having learnt all the information. Surely it’s counterintuitive to do anything else? In fact, this couldn’t be further from the truth.\nActive recall involves retrieving information from memory through, essentially, testing yourself at every stage of the revision process. This can be from the very first time you approach the information. The very act of retrieving information and data from our brains not only strengthens our ability to retain information but also improves connections in our brains between different concepts.\nResearch from 2013 which analysed hundreds of separate studies about effective revision techniques, concluded that testing, or active recall, is a technique that has ‘high utility’ and can be implemented effectively with minimal training.\nThese studies from 1939 and 2010 provide valuable verification of the effectiveness of active recall but it was a study from 2011 that I found particularly convincing. This study found that testing yourself just once is more effective than rereading a chapter four times.\nPerhaps the reason we don’t like to use active recall is that it’s more difficult and mentally taxing than rereading. But the key point is revision should be cognitively difficult. It’s useful to think about this in terms of going to the gym – if you’re lifting weights that are light, you’re not going to make much progress. But if you’re lifting weights that test your strength, you’re more likely to develop muscle faster. It’s the same with developing the ‘muscle’ of your brain – the harder we have to work to retrieve information, the more effective our brains will become in storing and recalling that information in the future.\nActive Recall Strategies\nSo, how can we apply active recall in our own studies? Are there any strategies that are more effective? Well, first of all, almost anything we do that requires us to use cognitive effort and brain power to retrieve information is going to be helpful. However, more specifically, I used a number of strategies which utilised active recall and below are three approaches that I’ve found useful.\nClosed Book\nIf you can’t quite break the habit of making notes, instead of copying directly out of the textbook, try to learn a topic before writing out how you would explain the key points and key concepts in your own words but with the book closed. Once you’ve written down as much as you can remember, open the book and add the parts you missed.\nThis may sound simplistic but it was particularly effective when I was preparing for my third year exams in psychology when I’d made essay plans and, in order to commit them to memory, I decided to draw spider diagrams of each plan with my book closed. I’d draw out as much as I could from memory and afterwards go back to my actual plan and fill in any information that was missing.\nAlternative to Making Notes…Ask Questions\nDespite evidence showing that note-taking isn’t an effective revision technique, it still feels intuitively productive to write things down, right? I didn’t want to completely stop making notes so I tried to adapt this desire to make notes and began to write questions for myself.\nThis strategy resembles the ‘Cornell Note-Taking’ method – the process of writing questions for yourself based upon the material in the syllabus. This produces a list of questions with the main idea being that instead of passively rereading or highlighting the information as we’re often tempted to do, we’re forced to actively engage in cognitive effort to retrieve the information to answer the questions which strengthens connections between information in our brains and improves our ability to recall that information in an exam.\nAnki\nAnki is a flashcard app that allows you to create online flashcards which you can use to test yourself in practice sessions. Apart from flashcards automatically being a form of active recall – where you need to try to remember the content, this app in particular also uses an algorithm built around active recall and spaced repetition and hence learns as you progress through your studies and revision.\nI found Anki particularly useful for two key reasons:\n\nFirstly, memorising particular facts – for example, as a medical student I used it a lot for pharmacology – learning the names of drugs and what they do.\nSecondly, I also used it to help memorise particular paragraphs that I could slot into appropriate essays.\n\nCheck out the video for how I specifically used Anki to great effect in medical school.\nScoping the Subject\nFeeling overwhelmed is common amongst students. When we’re in the day to day study of school or university, It’s easy to focus on the detail. We can get lost in individual lessons, compartmentalising what we’re learning into discrete buckets and lose focus of the bigger picture. As the old saying goes, we end up losing the forest for the trees.\nScoping the subject is one of the simplest yet most effective techniques that I’ve come across to both combat this feeling AND an essential step to lay the foundations for an effective study routine.\nThe idea is that in order to understand something we need to understand where it fits into the wider picture. A subject can often seem daunting until it’s broken down into its constituent parts and this method of scoping your course is, in itself, a very valuable use of time.\nEssentially, scoping the subject is about taking the time to go through our entire subject and conduct an extensive audit of all the different topics that we have to cover; what are they, how confident are we with each of them and where do we need to focus our time. It’s about taking time to concentrate on the birds-eye view of what you are learning.\nFor example, in medicine many of the books are presented in alphabetical order which doesn’t make any sense at all and so instead of going through the work from A to Z, it’s about taking a step back and seeing what the subject is all about. Which topics can be grouped? How are these two topics linked and can I learn them simultaneously?\nThe overall idea behind scoping the subject is that it allows you to start off with the broad picture and then narrow down which is a much better way than starting with the detail and losing sight of the bigger picture. If we lose sight of the bigger picture, it’s very easy to quickly become overwhelmed, lose motivation and lack any drive to study.\nThe Feynman Technique \nThere’s a difference between knowing the name of something and understanding it. When we’re studying, it can be easy to think that we have a grasp of a subject, especially if we feel confident that we’ve learnt our notes and find the topic very familiar. However, how often have you stopped to try and explain a concept rather than simply convinced yourself that you’ve learnt it? This is where the Feynman Technique can help.\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool Richard Feynman\nThe method is based around the idea that one of the most effective techniques to enhance your understanding is to imagine that you are teaching the material to someone who has absolutely no idea about the topic such as a small child.\nThe method was named after Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for being able to explain complex scientific material in simplified terms and diagrams that people could understand, affording him the nickname ‘The Great Explainer’.\nThe Process\nSo how do you use it? There are four steps to follow:\n\nChoose a topic you have recently studied and/or a topic for which you’d like to test your knowledge and understanding.\nExplain the concept using simple language. Pretend you are teaching and explaining it to a small child or someone who has never come across the topic before. The key here is simplicity – explain the concept using simple language. Don’t simply define the concept but, if it is a mathematical concept for instance, work through examples to show how the concept works in practice.\nIdentify the areas you found particularly problematic and/or the gaps in your explanation and return to your notes, lectures, textbook until your understanding of these areas has improved. Pinpoint the parts where you had to resort to using technical terms and challenge yourself to break down those terms into simpler terminology. The key is not only to identify complex areas of your own explanations but also to challenge and identify where you have made assumptions based on what you already understand intuitively.\nReview and simplify further; ask yourself the question – could you explain this to a five-year old? If the answer is no, go back and repeat the process and your understanding so that you could. The technique enables you to quickly overview a concept, identify areas that are weaker and, critically, requires active learning as you are forced to move beyond passively rereading or highlighting and actively think about how you would explain a particular concept in simple terms. Explaining concepts in this way enables you to reconstruct the core ideas and topics in your own words which helps reinforce understanding and comprehension.\n\nNotetaking (Mindmaps and Cornell Method) \nWe’ve already concluded that note-taking is, in general, a technique that should be avoided. However, that doesn’t mean that note-taking is entirely futile. Here are some general guidelines for taking effective notes during a class/lecture and some useful methods for doing this.\nGeneral Key Points When Notetaking:\n\nTry to be brief and summarise the content in your own words, not the words of the teacher/lecturer. The main goal is to understand the content not simply to record exactly what is said.\nPay close attention to the introduction and the summary of the class / lecture as this will give you a very good ideas as to how your notes should perhaps be structured as well as the key points of the class.\nIdentify the key points and associate key questions which can be used later in your revision through active recall and spaced repetition.\nTaking notes during class should start before the class – this might sound counterintuitive but preparation is vital. A good level of pre-reading is just making a note of the chapter headings. It doesn’t really matter what you use, but it’s extremely helpful to pre-read the lecture to get an idea of what’s going to be converted. If you’ve got time – Other things you can do – review notes from the previous lecture if it’s related OR if there is a reading list for the lecture, try to read a few sources just to gain some information before the class begins. Both these techniques should ensure that you are more prepared and alert when the lecture/class starts.\nIf you can, try to stick to handwriting your notes. Research suggests that we think more intensely if we are making notes by hand rather than by laptop as it requires more cognitive concentration.\nIf you’re insisting on using your laptop for whatever reason, the key point to emphasise is to avoid writing out verbatim what is being said by the lecturer. As the old cliché makes clear, quality over quantity!\n\nDifferent Methods:\n\nOutline method / Linear Note Taking:\nCreate main bullet points of the main topics of the lecture and add sub-points underneath that relate to each main topic area.\nEach time note down the key points as well as the key questions that arise from the topic and which you can use to test yourself through active recall later. Making the questions now will save you time in the future when you revisit your notes for revision purposes.\nCornell Note Taking System\nThis system is based on the value of writing questions for yourself. It’s a system for taking and reviewing notes that was devised at Cornell University in the 1950s.\nDivide a piece of paper into three sections – Cues, Main Space, Summary – in accordance with the picture below [to be inserted]. The notes from the lecture go into the main space and the small margin on the left is for questions, keywords or comments that will then not only make the reviewing and exam preparation process easier but also more effective. The last section would contain the summary, in as few words as possible.\nMind-Maps\nThe mind mapping design enables you to easily sort through different details and identify relationships among these details. It can even help you discover new relationships among seemingly unrelated ideas and information.\nThese relationships are easier to identify because mind mapping serves as a means of simplifying and distilling complex information into a pictorial representation which our brains find easier to compute.\n\nThe Feynman Technique\nThere’s a difference between knowing the name of something and understanding it. When we’re studying, it can be easy to think that we have a grasp of a subject, especially if we feel confident that we’ve learnt our notes and find the topic very familiar. However, how often have you stopped to try and explain a concept rather than simply convinced yourself that you’ve learnt it? This is where the Feynman Technique can help.\nThe first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool Richard Feynman\nThe method is based around the idea that one of the most effective techniques to enhance your understanding is to imagine that you are teaching the material to someone who has absolutely no idea about the topic such as a small child.\nThe method was named after Nobel prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, who was known for being able to explain complex scientific material in simplified terms and diagrams that people could understand, affording him the nickname ‘The Great Explainer’.\nThe Process\nSo how do you use it? There are four steps to follow:\n\nChoose a topic you have recently studied and/or a topic for which you’d like to test your knowledge and understanding.\nExplain the concept using simple language. Pretend you are teaching and explaining it to a small child or someone who has never come across the topic before. The key here is simplicity – explain the concept using simple language. Don’t simply define the concept but, if it is a mathematical concept for instance, work through examples to show how the concept works in practice.\nIdentify the areas you found particularly problematic and/or the gaps in your explanation and return to your notes, lectures, textbook until your understanding of these areas has improved. Pinpoint the parts where you had to resort to using technical terms and challenge yourself to break down those terms into simpler terminology. The key is not only to identify complex areas of your own explanations but also to challenge and identify where you have made assumptions based on what you already understand intuitively.\nReview and simplify further; ask yourself the question – could you explain this to a five-year old? If the answer is no, go back and repeat the process and your understanding so that you could.\n\nThe technique enables you to quickly overview a concept, identify areas that are weaker and, critically, requires active learning as you are forced to move beyond passively rereading or highlighting and actively think about how you would explain a particular concept in simple terms. Explaining concepts in this way enables you to reconstruct the core ideas and topics in your own words which helps reinforce understanding and comprehension.\nNotetaking\nWe’ve already concluded that note-taking is, in general, a technique that should be avoided.

The fact is we’re all different in how much time we spend studying but if active recall is an effective technique, the next question I want to address is how we should be using it to enhance our performance. This is where spaced repetition comes in.\nSpaced Repetition vs Cramming – The Theory and Evidence\nAs the name suggests, spaced repetition involves spacing your revision and reviewing topics at specific intervals over a period of time.\nIt can be explained by the ‘forgetting curve’. The forgetting curve is the idea that over time we forget things at an exponential rate – akin to the half-life of radioactive substances if you want a scientific analogy.\nThe way we can take advantage of the forgetting curve is through breaking the cycle by reviewing material at spaced intervals. The more that we practice and the more spaced this repetition becomes, the more likely we are to encode this information into our long-term memory.\nIn essence, the idea behind spaced repetition is that you allow your brain to forget some of the information to ensure that the active recall process is mentally taxing. The psychology literature suggests that the harder that your brain has to work to retrieve information, the more likely that that information will be encoded.\n\nApplying Spaced Repetition\nIn practical terms, applying active recall and spaced repetition could be as simple as taking a pen and paper at the end of the day and answering your active recall questions, or constructing a spider diagram of what you’ve learnt.\nThis active recall-spaced repetition combination can easily be adapted into our studying. For instance, let’s say you studied Topic 1 and Topic 2 one morning and planned to move to Topic 3 and Topic 4 in the afternoon. The results from this study demonstrate that you should go back to Topic 1 and write down – through active recall – what you can remember before moving onto Topic 3. You would then repeat this for Topic 2 after having studied Topic 3 and so forth.\nIn essence, spaced repetition over days and weeks as well as reviewing content on the same day, can both be extremely helpful for improving exam performance.\nBut I know that different techniques work better for some people compared to others. The following strategies are the ones that worked effectively for me – if you’re struggling with your studying, then perhaps give these a try.\nMy ‘Magic’ Spaced Repetition Spreadsheet System\nAs you may have seen in past videos, one of the key techniques that I’ve found particularly effective is a spreadsheet system that I adapted using Google Sheets. (NB: I preferred using Google Sheets specifically as it gives you access across devices and allows you to update your spreadsheet wherever you are).\nThe approach involves making a sheet for each subject and then in the first column of each spreadsheet, you list all the topics for that subject. To do this, it is essential to ‘scope’ your subject. This might sound simple and obvious but in offering advice to students over recent years, it’s been quite astounding how few students know their course inside out or know exactly what topics they have in their subject. So, even if it takes a whole day to compile using your syllabus and/or past exam papers, scoping your subject is essential in order to produce a list of all the topics that you need which will make revision far more straightforward.\nOnce you’ve done this, the actual spreadsheet system is very simple but extremely effective. In essence, every time you study a topic and actively recall information from that topic, then you write the current date in the column along in the spreadsheet. Marking a date is not just when you have read a chapter in the textbook, that’s too passive, you can only mark a date when you have actively recalled information, facts, quotes or essay plans. After having studied other topics and repeated this exercise, you build up a list of repetitions as well as a table which enables you to keep track not only of when you last studied that topic but, by colour coding each topic based on your comprehension, you can also start to rank how confident you are on each particular topic.\nBelow is an example of a spreadsheet that I used in my Third Year when I was studying psychology.\n\nFlashcards\nFlashcards can be one of the most powerful and versatile learning tools you can use when it comes to studying for exams. They not only promote active recall which, as we have discussed, is one of the most useful techniques that you can use, but using flashcard apps can also automate spaced repetition for you.\nI’m not a fan of using flashcards for general broad concepts, I think other techniques such as the Feynman technique are more effective there but they can certainly be useful tools for learning key bits of information.\nThe key with flashcards is to avoid illusions of competence – when our brains confuse recognition with recall.\nSo, what is the best way to use them?\n\nIf you are trying to learn a complex topic – break it down so that it easier to understand.\nAlthough people often don’t like using flashcards because of the time it takes to make them, it’s important that you do make them yourself because one of the most important aspects of learning is making notes in your own words. This helps to build stronger neural pathways which are unique to you.\nMost effective to have a question or key term on one side and the answer or definition on the other. We often fall into the trap of simply writing out notes onto flashcards and end up with a catalogue of summarised notes. Flashcards are most effective when they force you to work your memory to retrieve information. If they are just another page of notes, no retrieval will be possible.\nAs with highlighting – less is more when making flashcards.\n\nThis paper examined the effectiveness of a common strategy of students to set aside (or drop) items we think we know. They found that dropping flashcards had small but consistently negative effects on learning – in other words, we should continue to recall information on topics even if we think we have a firm understanding of the content. (https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Optimising-self-regulated-study%3A-the-benefits-and-Kornell-Bjork/3b000dec1a3881660c30c5e87f9a404521d6c738)\nI use Anki which is a flashcard app that allows you to create online flashcards. It uses an algorithm built around active recall and spaced repetition and learns as you progress through your studies and revision.\nOnce again though, flashcards are not the silver bullet – they should be used in combination with the other techniques I have discussed here.\nMemory Techniques\nIt’s definitely not advisable to rely on memory techniques as your sole strategy for studying. There are multiple techniques that you can use to help improve memory but, as we emphasised earlier in this post, understanding is key to success in our studies and our exams. That being said, supplementing our studying tool kit with some memory based techniques doesn’t hurt.\nOne of the popular techniques is to use mnemonics. A mnemonic system is a technique for remembering information and works through association to enhance your memory by creating a ‘filing cabinet’ in your mind.\nThe Peg system is one of the most effective mnemonic techniques. A ‘peg’ is a mental hook on which you ‘hang’ information and the peg system functions through pre-memorising a list of words that you can easily associate with numbers they represent (1 to 10, 1-100, 1-1000, etc.). Those objects then form the pegs of the system.\nIn other words, it works by using a list that you already know (for instance, the numbers 1 to 10, or the alphabet) and associating new facts or information with each number or letter. For example, you end up associating a particular fact to the number ‘5’ or perhaps a quote to number ‘8’.\nConsequently, you construct this cognitive filing system.\nA common misconception is that the pegs can only be used once – in fact, the lists can be used multiple times for different material. Our brains are capable of distinguishing between the same numerical list (or the same pegs) being used multiple times for different information. One study on memory systems showed that normal people were able to memorise 6 different lists at the same time using the same pegs.\nYou can even combine peg systems with other memory techniques such as the loci system (or memory palace) which I’ll discuss next.\nAs with all these memory techniques, they require practice to hone your skills, you cannot expect the system to work perfectly straightaway but with a bit of practice it can certainly become an effective weapon to add to your study armoury.\nThe second popular and powerful memory technique is the memory palace. The technique is based around the idea that our brains are well-adapted to remembering specific places – memory palace just acts as a fancy metaphor. Think Sherlock Holmes. This technique is famously one that is used in memory competitions and allows people to be able to memorise whole decks of cards in a few seconds for example (incredible).\nThere are a number of steps: this can’t be followed – think we need an example here\n\nFirstly, choose a place that you are familiar with and that you can easily visualise. Decide upon a specific route through this place as well – static imagery is not as effective. Examples could include your home, local streets, place of work, school…\nSecondly, follow the ‘route’ that you will take and mentally note the specific features which could serve as ‘memory slots’.\nRelatedly, the next step is to imprint the memory palace into your mind – this is perhaps the most important of these first few steps. An excellent knowledge of your location will drastically enhance the effectiveness of this technique.\nFinally, use association to peg information to the various memory slots you identified earlier. Ensure that the visualisations and associations are striking – boring associations will be harder to remember so make the links as innovative as possible.\n\nAs with all the peg system, this technique does require practice. It is not as easy as it may first appear, and it does take a lot of time to understand and set up but with a bit of practice it can certainly become one of the most powerful memory techniques to help with your studies.\nAlso as before, do not rely on memory techniques for studying. They are useful little tools to help your studying but should be used to supplement your understanding rather than simply to memorise content.\n\nHow To Actually Study For Exams – Plan\nIt’s quite easy when planning a revision timetable to commit certain subjects to a few solid days then move on to the next. This is known as ‘blocking’ and it comes easily to us because it’s how we’re always taught through textbooks.\nInterleaving is a process whereby you aim to mix up subjects and topics and, unlike ‘blocking’ which holds information in your short-term memory, interleaving can help to strengthen your memory associations over a longer period of time.\nThere’s evidence that has shown that if you interleave different concepts together, i.e by following a question on one topic with a question on a different topic which requires a different technique to answer it, this can produce better test scores.\nIn essence, with traditional blocked practice, we don’t often need to identify the strategy because every problem can be solved in the same way with the same strategy. Interleaving changes this by forcing us to consider and choose the appropriate strategy for different questions.\nConsequently, interleaving can feel more difficult. But, as we have already discussed, it’s when we are finding studying difficult that our time is being spent most productively. Learning should be mentally taxing and interleaving introduces variety which produces difficulty as well as forces your brain to adapt, work with different techniques and make connections which will make your studying more effective and efficient.\nResearch into the effectiveness of interleaving from 2010 found that although interleaving practice impaired practice session performance [i.e it made the actual study session more difficult] it doubled scores on a test given one day later [i.e it improved exam performance in the long term].\nIt turns out that variety is not just the spice of life but the spice of studying too.\nProspective Revision Timetable\nRevision timetables are often praised as the best way to structure your time in a coherent, logical manner. It’s certainly true that they can have some benefits and I know that revision timetables can work for some people – that’s absolutely fine. But are we using them in the correct way? Is the standard ‘prospective’ timetable really the most effective technique?\nThe Standard Prospective Timetable\nProspective means looking forward — we plan out our schedule by writing our dates in advance along with the topics we want to cover. However, over the years, I’ve found three main problems with this approach:\n\nThis standard method requires us to look into the future and work out what topics we think we’re going to have issues with. For some, this might be crystal clear but, for most of us, it’s pretty unrealistic. Laying out topics beforehand may lead to either needlessly repeating subjects, or not covering our weakest topics enough. Also, occasionally life just gets in the way. We can’t help that. A friend’s birthday or unexpected emergencies can interrupt our entire schedule and render our neatly organised timetable useless.\nProspective timetables encourage us to think of revision as a function of time rather than topics. It doesn’t really matter how we fill our time. What matters is understanding the content. Rather than thinking each day I need to get three topics done, I find it helpful to think what topics do I need to work to improve.\nActually creating the timetable. Personally, I used to view this as an exercise in procrastination — we’re putting off studying by working on a neatly organised timetable and playing with highlighters to create a schedule that 9 times out of 10 we won’t even follow. Sounds a little absurd to me. Friends of mine even managed to put off studying for weeks by rationalising that a timetable needed to be created first. The lack of activation energy engaged them in a damaging cycle of procrastination that does nobody any good when exams are fast approaching.\n\nSo, if the common prospective timetable is unhelpful, what should we be doing? Enter retrospective timetabling.\nRetrospective Revision Timetable\nRetrospective revision timetables reverse the conventional method. Rather than starting with a timeline of dates, we start with a list of subjects and topics that we have compiled through scoping our subject.\nMy Spaced Repetition Spreadsheet System, which you can read about here, is an example of a retrospective timetable in action. The approach involves making a sheet for each subject and, in the first column of each spreadsheet, you list all the topics for that subject.\nOnce you’ve done this, the spreadsheet system is very simple. In essence, every time you study a topic and, crucially, test yourself through active recall, then you write the current date in the column corresponding to that topic in the spreadsheet.\nAfter repeating this exercise, you build up a list of repetitions as well as a table which enables you to keep track of not only when you last studied that topic but, by colour coding each topic based on your comprehension, you can start to rank how confident you are for each area of the course.\n\nBy inputting dates into my spreadsheet as well as colour coding my understanding, each morning I can look through my lists, identify which topics have a red mark by them and/or haven’t been covered for a few days, and then work on those topics for that day.\nOver time, we develop a deeper understanding of all of our topics and, by working on our weakest areas each day, we’re tackling the content that we find most difficult which is therefore more cognitively demanding and hence more effective at improving our long-term memory.\nThe first thing to do is start with what you DON’T know. We often gravitate towards topics that we feel comfortable studying because we know the basic principles and it feels easier. But for your revision to be effective, you have to keep reminding yourself to study topics that you are least comfortable with.\nThe more effort it takes you to learn a topic and the more effort it takes you to actively recall information – the stronger that information is going to get encoded in your long-term memory.\nTo summarise, the main reasons why I prefer a retrospective approach to timetable over the classic prospective timetables are:\n\nWe don’t have to look into the future.\nWe can see an overview of our topics as well as our confidence with each topic.\nIt encourages us to think of our studying in terms of topics, instead of time.\nIt’s infintely more easy and fast to construct one of these spreadsheets that it spares us the cognitive effort of having to look weeks into the future.\nIt accounts for unpredictable events that could offset our entire calendar.\n\nI understand that everyone is different and timetables do work for some people but if you’re finding that your standard ‘prospective’ timetable doesn’t really work then perhaps try the retrospective spreadsheet system.\n\nHow To Actually Study For Exams – Focus\nReducing Distractions\nOne of the most difficult aspects of revising is maintaining concentration without having your attention pulled away – breaking your focus and interrupting your studies.\nDigital devices are the primary culprits of this attention-theft in the modern society yet we know that they are equally essential to optimising our studying.\nBUT there are a number of things that you can do to prevent being distracted by your phone – some more obvious than others – with all focused on increasing the friction for everyday actions such that you don’t resort to relying upon your subconscious.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is turning your phone off – phones take time to power on.\nIf you can’t turn off your phone completely, then at least turn it to airplane mode and turn off bluetooth and Wifi networks so that you cannot receive any messages from any social media channels.\nPhysically place it face down on the desk – without the screen lighting up, you are less likely to want to pick it up at all.\nBUT even better is simply to leave it in a completely different room or give it to a friend or family member.\nConstant connectivity is not as essential as we have convinced ourselves that it is in modern society.\n\n3 Actionable Things you can do on your phone RIGHT NOW:\n1. Rearrange apps on your home screen\nThis might sound like a really simple and pointless thing to do but it is very effective but it disrupts your muscle memory. We get so used to using the same apps every single day that pressing on certain apps has become subconscious. You’ll be surprised how effective this simple change can be in just making you stop and think about what you are pressing on and, if it’s something that will distract you, whether you want to press on it!\n2. Bury Social Media Apps In Folders\nWhat I mean by this is make one large folder for as many apps as you can and put your social media apps on the very last page of that folder.\nBy doing this you are introducing friction into the process of accessing these apps as you’ll have to take time and thought in order to access them. The idea is that this will give your conscious brain enough time to process what you are doing and hence give you time to think is this really helpful?\n3. Turn Your Phone Grey\nThis might seem like a slightly strange suggestion but it can be immensely powerful – not just when you are revising but also in general if you want to try to use your phone as much.\nIcons on smartphones are designed to grab your attention – red is used for notifications because it is a colour that our brains are wired to associate with immediacy and importance.\nHence by draining all icons of colour the appeal of the screen is diminished and we feel less inclined to scroll aimlessly through a bland screen of text.\nMy friend’s weekly usage of his phone dropped by almost 50% just through doing this.\nWithout colour, your brain is not attracted to colours of particularly familiar apps and the attention-demanding red notifications lose all potency and cannot grapple for your attention.\nCertainly Instagram or Snapchat are less appealing in black and white!\nIf you have iPhone, this can be done by going into Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display and Text Size &gt; Colour Filters &gt; Toggle filter on.\n3 Actionable Things you can do on your computer RIGHT NOW:\n1. Log out of all social media accounts and change your passwords to something difficult to remember – a random series of letters and numbers for instance.\n2. Download Chrome extensions to:\n\nMonitor time spent on certain websites – StayFocusd, Timewarp, Timestats\nBlock you using certain websites at particular times – Blocksite\n(See https://www.breakthetwitch.com/10-free-extensions/)\n\n3. Customise Facebook so you can remove all ads or completely hide the news feed – F.B. Purity\nShould You Study With Music?\nThe question of whether listening to music is helpful for studying is quite a controversial topic. Some people believe it can enhance focus and concentration whilst others find it’s only a source of distraction.\nEvidence suggests that listening to music can help to improve your mood which could then have knock-on effects on your ability to study. For instance, listening to music can trigger the release of dopamine which is a neurotransmitter that promotes feelings of happiness and excitement. Listening to music has also been shown to reduce cortisol levels which helps reduce stress and anxiety, thus leading to more efficient study.\nIn 1993, a researcher called Dr Gordon Shaw suggested that listening to Mozart could help improve cognitive function and performance which became known as the Mozart effect. The Mozart Effect has since been found to be misleading but that’s not to say that listening to classical music isn’t helpful at all; it’s certainly likely to be more effective than loud or distracting pop/rock.\n\nResearch: Mozart Effect-Shmozart Effect: A Meta-Analysis\n\nIndeed, some evidence suggests that although listening to classical music won’t increase intelligence, it could help us study better. A French study, found that students who listened to a lecture with classical music playing in the background performed better on a test compared to those who had the lecture without music.\nTake a look at my ‘Study With Me’ playlist on Spotify for more music that I have found helpful during my studies.\nStudying With Friends\nMuch like listening to music, studying with other people is very much a personal choice. It changed the game by making studying more enjoyable for me but I know that others find working alone to be far more productive. There are a couple of general guidelines that I followed which might help you find a group dynamic that works for you and a group of friends too.\nFirstly you want to find the right group of people who are motivated to study at a similar level. You want to have a group of friends who are all similarly motivated.\nSecondly, you need to have someone in the group to take charge of the session. When I was at university, we would gather in one of the libraries and use the Pomodoro technique with someone assigned to be the Pomodoro master, keeping time for the whole group.\nThirdly, if we were all studying the same topic or collectively answering a bank of questions for instance, we would make a point of giving everyone in the group a chance to think about the answer and this required imposing moments of silence. This prevents anyone from dominating and giving answers before others have had a chance to think and makes the overall experience of collective studying more inclusive.\nHow To Make The Most Of Your Time\nThe Pomodoro Technique\nThe Pomodoro Technique is perhaps the simplest (and one of the best known) productivity and time-management strategy which we can use.\nThe technique was ‘invented’ in the early 1990s by developer, entrepreneur, and author Francesco Cirillo. Cirillo noticed that when faced with large tasks or a series of assignments, we’re able to be most effective if we break the work down into short, timed intervals (called Pomodoros) which are spaced out by short breaks.\nInteresting Side Note: Cirillo named the system Pomodoro after the tomato-shaped timer he used to track his work as a university student.\nIn essence, it’s a cyclical system based around working in short bursts of 25 minutes with intermittent breaks, of 5 minutes, which can help to improve motivation, creativity and efficiency.\nTheory\nThis theory has been supported by scientific literature too. This study upends the intuitive theory about the nature of attention by demonstrating that short breaks from a task can dramatically improve one’s ability to focus for prolonged periods. The researchers concluded that, when faced with long tasks, it’s best to impose brief breaks on yourself which will actually help you stay focused on your task.\nPractice\nWith that evidence in mind, the Pomodoro technique takes on even more importance. So how does the Pomodoro technique work in practice? Well, the method can broadly be described as follows:\n\nChoose a task that you’d like to get done – personally, it was writing this blog post.\nSet the timer (Pomodoro) for 25 minutes.\nWork on the task until the timer rings.\nTake a short break for 5 minutes before repeating the process again.\nEvery 4 ‘Pomodoros’ take a longer break of 15/20 minutes before starting again with the 25 minutes on / 5 minutes off cycle.\n\nThe evidence shows it can improve results and performance but it can also help manage distractions, improve focus and concentration and, hence, productivity and efficiency.\nIt can also help to break down larger tasks into manageable periods of time enabling you to feel less daunted by the size of one large assignment. Breaking it down can help you to manage expectations and more accurately keep track of how long you have spent on the task.\nIt’s important to recognise that the 20/25 minutes shouldn’t be seen as a completely rigid structure that you absolutely HAVE TO stick to. If you’re focussed and feel like you need an extra 5/10 minutes to finish the work that you are doing then do that and then take a break.\nThe absolutely critical takeaway from this method is that regular breaks are critical to your productivity.\nParkinson’s Law\nThis concept was written by Cyril Parkinson in 1955 based on his experience in the British Civil Service. The main theory being that Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion / Work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it.\nParkinson found that as the length of time allocated to a task became shorter, the task became simpler and easier to solve. Whereas even simple tasks increased in complexity to fill up the time allocated to them.\nThis means that if you know that you’ve got 5 days to complete a task, the likelihood is that you’ll take all 5 days to get over the finish line, even if in reality you probably could’ve completed the task far sooner.\nThe more time we give ourselves to do something the more time the thing will take. We’ve probably all experienced this at some point – for example, if we’re under pressure from having to complete an essay due the next day, then we’ll find a way to get it done but if we knew it was due the following month, we’d probably procrastinate and do more research than is necessary.\nBy assigning the right amount of time to a task, we can gain back more time and the task will reduce in complexity – making us more productive and protecting our mental health.\nResources\nRecommended Books:\n\nMake it Stick\nTricks of the Mind\nHow to Develop a Super-Power Memory\nThe Motivation Myth\nDeep Work\nThe Pomodoro Technique\n\nRecommended Studies:\n\nImproving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: Promising Directions From Cognitive and Educational Psychology (Dunlosky et al 2013)\nEffectiveness of highlighting for retention of text material (Fowler &amp; Barker 1974)\nType of Highlighted Material and Examination Performance (Leicht &amp; Cashen 2014)\nBetter Mood and Better Performance: Learning Rule-Described Categories Is Enhanced by Positive Mood (Nadler et al 2010)\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610387441\n\nRecommended Articles:\n\nScrew Motivation – What you need is Discipline\nPractical Discipline\nhttps://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away?t=1582736568362\nhttps://www.wired.com/2011/01/the-neuroscience-of-music/\n\nRecommended Videos:\n\nMy video about why rereading, summarising and highlight are ineffective, and the evidence behind why Active Recall is the single best learning technique\nMy video about the evidence behind Spaced Repetition and some ways in which we can apply it to our studying\nMy Favourite Note-Taking App for Students – Notion"

    "article_body": "Last night, I had a catch-up call with some YouTuber friends (Matt D’Avella, Thomas Frank, Joey Schweitzer, Captain Sinbad and Nathaniel Drew). We chatted for around 2 hours. Some notes.\nEvery YouTuber at every size worries about the algorithm. One of the biggest challenges of being a YouTuber is trying not to worry about the algorithm.\nThe highlight reel looks very different to the behind-the-scenes. The guys complimented me on my apparent disregard for the algorithm, and willingness to put out random content (eg: piano + singing) that had nothing to do with productivity. In reality, I was shitting myself when I pressed publish on that video, and it absolutely tanked in performance, which made me sad for many days.\nNathaniel’s taken a break from posting regularly recently. We all worry so much about consistency and about ‘channel momentum’. But his doesn’t seem to have changed at all. Could consistency be a myth? Maybe for some channels, it might be.\nWe’re all trying to be sincere with our videos, but not too serious about them. ‘Sincere’ = recognising that it’s all just a game, and we’re going to play our best, but not let it ruin our lives. ‘Serious’ = taking the game too seriously.\nWe often don’t watch each other’s videos, so as to not accidentally-end-up-copying an idea. But we probably worry too much about appearing as though we’re stealing ideas from one another anyway.\nMost of us feel ‘experienced-starved’ because of covid. It’s like we’ve been living the same day everyday for months. When creating content of any kind, it’s always more interesting and fulfilling to draw from first-hand experience, rather than to distil second-hand experience. This is a big part of why I’m heading back into Medicine, rather than aiming to be a ‘full time YouTuber’. Doing stuff and then talking about it is very different to reading stuff and then talking about it.\nAmongst all of us (and lots of my other YouTuber friends), there’s a general trend towards I want to make videos I enjoy, rather than just focusing on videos that I know will perform well.\nRecurring calendar events are the best. Matt initiated the first call 3 months ago, and now it’s in the calendar for every quarter. This is going to ensure it actually happens.\nSomeone always needs to initiate. If you’ve got a group of friends, then try to be the initiator of a regular group activity (with calendar links). They’ll all be thankful for it.\nSome level of structure is also good. The conversation was very free-flowing, but had a general structure of ‘each person sharing what they’re working on this quarter’, which springboarded into interesting discussions.\nThanks, guys for the ongoing inspiration. Special shoutout to @tomfrankly for bringing us together, and to @mattdavella for organising the calls  Until next time xx"

    ],
    "article_body": "This is the first in a series of posts where I’ll be sharing stuff I’ve learned from 5 years of running a pretty successful medical education startup whilst being a medical student at Cambridge University.\nQuick background – my company (6med) has been running since 2013, and averages £125,000 in annual revenue. We’ve taught over 5,000 students across the UK, Singapore, Hong Kong and The Netherlands, with over 20,000 using our online resources. We’ve done this as a small team of friends, all studying medicine full-time but teaching courses/making websites/doing 6med stuff on some evenings and weekends. We’ve learned a lot over the years of doing this, and want to share some of it with you – actionable advice that you can hopefully apply to your own life in your own side projects.\nSo if you’re a student (or otherwise engaged full-time) but might be interested in starting your own business/startup/app/project on the side, hopefully you’ll find some of this stuff useful.\nYou should learn how to code\nIf there’s one piece of advice I could give to anyone interested in starting their own business, it’s that you should learn the basics of web design and coding.\nWhy? Two reasons. Firstly, knowing how to code opens up possibilities for business ideas in your mind. It helps you notice problems in day-to-day life that can be solved by technology. And secondly, knowing how to code helps you execute your ideas much, much faster than everyone else. Let’s explore these in a bit more detail.\nKnowing code helps you notice business ideas\nThe way to get startup ideas is not to try to think of startup ideas. It’s to look for problems, preferably problems you have yourself. Paul Graham (Y Combinator)\nThis is golden advice when it comes to generating ideas. There’s often very little to be gained from sitting in a room with your tech-savvy mates and thinking right guys, let’s come up with a startup idea to make money. Instead, the best ideas come about from experience, from noticing problems that you have in your own life, and then generating solutions for those problems.\nKnowing the basics of how to code helps with both. Let’s say you’re a surgical trainee, and you have to fill out consent forms for the same appendicectomy operation 10 times per week. You duplicate exactly the same information on each form – in fact, the only thing that really changes is the patient’s name and their signature. A ’normal’ surgical trainee might regard this as no more than a minor annoyance, and not even consider how the process could be streamlined. But a surgical trainee who taught herself how to code for a few weeks at university – she will immediately notice that it would be pretty easy to make an app for consenting patients, one that automatically fills out the complications, leaving her with more time to explain stuff to the patient and less time writing the same information over and over again. This, in fact, is the story behind Surgical Consent, an app that does what it says on the tin and is being trialled at various hospitals this year.\nThere are literally thousands of examples like this – where an idea for innovation is first noticed by someone with a background in coding. That person knows how easy it is to hack together an app that talks to a database and that could save a lot of time for real people, and so they start to notice areas in their working lives where that could be applied.\nKnowing code helps you execute your ideas\nKnowing the basics of design and code will also help you execute your ideas much, much faster than someone who doesn’t. In my example, I had the idea for the BMAT Crash Course one night during Ramadan while at the mosque. I mulled the idea over in my head on the way home, and had the website online and taking bookings exactly 7 days later. My background in design and code firstly made the idea feasible – it took the idea from it would be cool to run a local BMAT course to hmm, if I’m running a local BMAT course, I might as well make a website and advertise it nationally. This thought was what sparked the whole company, and if I didn’t have a basic background in design and code, 6med likely would have never happened, and I wouldn’t have put so much money in bitcoin…\nHow to learn how to code\nOkay, so you’re sold on the idea of learning how to code. You might even have dabbled with it a few times in the past, but never really got past the initial stages.\nCoding can often seem like a black box to those entering the field for the first time. There are so many languages, frameworks, platforms – how do you know where to begin?\nHere’s my suggestion – start with web development and completely ignore ‘app development’ (ie: iOS and Android) for the time being. Within web development, start by teaching yourself HTML and CSS. There are some very good courses on Codeschool, CodeCademy, Udemy, Coursera – many of them are free, but if you’re happy to pay £10 or so, you can get a really high quality course that’ll teach you the important stuff in a matter of a few days.\nOnce you’re familiar with HTML and CSS, you should learn Javascript which will teach you how to add interactivity to web pages, and will be a solid foundation for you to learn NodeJS. Again, Codeschool, Codecademy, Udemy etc, all have really good courses on Javascript and NodeJS that are quite fun to work through.\nHaving done this, you’ll now know how to ‘talk’ to a database, and once you can write code that talks to a database, you can spin up practically any app or website you can think of. Let’s say you’re Jack Dorsey and you have the idea for Twitter – your basic app is a text field for a tweet, and when you hit the ‘Tweet’ button, your code inserts an entry into the database. When you want to read a list of tweets, just retrieve them from the database. The ability to write code that talks to a database completely changes the game in terms of the possibilities you’ll see for businesses/apps/products as you go about your life.\nHow hard is it to learn to code?\nSo far, I might have made it sound like anyone can hop onto Udemy, learn how to code and then make the next Twitter.\nThat’s not what I’m suggesting. Coding can be quite hard in practice, but learning the basics is reasonably straightforward, and the basics are all you really need to kick-start your creativity. I can remember when I was first teaching myself coding in Year 8, and coming across the concept of databases and reading about how to write data to and read data from a database. I can remember my brain proverbially exploding at the implications, and spent the next few weeks of French lessons planning out how to make an online game:\nso we have a table that contains the player’s stats, like their health and stamina, and the amount of gold they have. We can have another table with all the various items, including their name, an image, a cost price. If a player wants to buy an item, we can retrieve the item from the items table, work out its cost, and subtract that from the player’s total_goldin the player_stats table\nI still go back to this simple concept of databases whenever I think of a new project. For example, when I first had the idea for an online BMAT question bank (BMAT Ninja), I came up with the database structure within a few minutes:\nOkay, so we want a table for the users containing their email and encrypted passwords. We want a table for all the questions, containing the question_textalong with option_a to option_e, and also the correct_answer and solution. To track a user’s progress through the question bank, we can have a completed_questions table that stores the user_id and the question_id of the question they just did, along with time_taken and user_selected_answerto see what answer they put.\nNone of this is particularly groundbreaking stuff, and by following a ‘Learn to code’ course on any of the websites I’ve suggested for a few weeks, you’ll have the power to (at least theoretically) build almost any website/web app you can think of. Sure, the process of actually building it will be hard and will probably take a lot of time, but by learning the basics of coding you’ll at least know what the possibilities are.\nAnd let’s say further down the line, you’re a working professional and you have an idea for a simple app based on a database that would save you and your colleagues time in your working lives. If you know the basics of coding, you can form the structure of the app in your head, and then find someone else to actually design/code the app for you – websites like Upwork.com are great for finding reasonably-priced freelance developers who can do precisely that.\nSo is coding hard? Yes. But is learning the basics of code particularly hard? Not really – with the wealth of incredible online courses available today, all you need is an inquisitive mind and the desire to work through the exercises to gain basic proficiency in a reasonable timeframe.\nConcluding Remarks\nSo yeah, if you’re thinking of starting a startup/business/app/whatever on the side, chances are it’ll be something at least loosely tech-related (because the barrier to entry for those is so low, and the potential upside is so high).\nIf you’re in that position then you should definitely learn how to code. I’ve got a medical student friend who started a £10 course on Udemy 3 weeks ago. He’s been enjoying working through the exercises, and with just a few hours in the evenings each week, he’s already taught himself HTML and CSS and is working through Javascript. He’s already made stuff like an online to-do list and a web-based game, and is looking forward to applying his newfound skills to problems he encounters within the medical field, with the long-term plan of hopefully spinning these solutions off into a startup of his own.\nI hope you enjoyed reading this post, or found it useful in some way, and wish you the very best of luck on your journey. If you need a hand, you can always reach out to me via Twitter/YouTube/Instagram.\n\nThis post was originally written for The New Medic, an initiative that I’m involved with. You should check that out to read more articles from medics who do much cooler stuff than I do on the side."

    "article_body": "YouTube Studio Gear (2021) – $11k Setup\nIf you’re a beginner, you certainly don’t need to spend this amount of money on gear. I’ve also got my 2017, 2018, and 2019 setups below, so if you’re looking for more budget options you can check those out.\nMain Camera – Sony A7Siii\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony A7Siii\nThe Sony A7Siii is the camera I currently use. It’s an amazing full frame camera.\nBuy\nMain Lens – Sony 16-35mm f/2.8 GM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony 16-35mm f/2.8 GM\nIf I could only use 1 lens forever, it would be this. 16mm for vlogging and wide shots, 24mm-ish for sitting at my desk, 35mm for B roll and sometimes for filming courses.\nBuy\nTravel Lens – Tamron 28-75mm F/2.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTamron 28-75mm F/2.8\nWhen I’m travelling, I leave the 24mm GM lens at home and just have this Tamron lens with me. It’s really nice, pretty reasonably priced (compared to the 24-70 Sony GM) and gets any shots I need to.\nBuy\nSecond Camera – Sony A7iii\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony A7iii\n‌I had a great run with the Sony a6500, but upgraded to the full-frame A7iii in early 2019 as my main camera. Video quality with the full frame lenses is insanely good. But today I use it as my second camera.\nThe A7iii is also my go-to travel camera. It’s a lot bulkier than the a6500 but I like having the Tamron 28-75 f2.8 lens on it as a one-camera-one-lens setup for travelling.\nBuy\nMicrophone – Sennheiser MKH 416\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSennheiser MKH 416\nThis is what all the pros use and I decided to splash out on one in December 2020. The audio isn’t massively different than the Rode NTG4+, but I like it.\nBuy\nXLR – XLR-K3M\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXLR-K3M\nSince December 2020, I’ve been using the XLR-3KM as it massively reduces friction in my production process. I can plug it straight into my Sony A7iii, which means I no longer need to use an external recorder and sync it all up in post.\nBuy\nTripod – Manfrotto Befree\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManfrotto Befree\nIt’s a tripod. Nothing particularly fancy about it. It’s quite light so I can travel with it if I feel like it. And I like the fact that it has the ball head for smooth pans.\nBuy\nKey Light – Aputure 120d Mk II with LightDome II\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAputure 120d Mk II with LightDome II\nI could never imagine spending £1,000 on a light, but it honestly makes such a difference to video quality that it’s completely worth it. This light now features in every single one of my videos, and even if it’s bright daylight outside, I still use this light because it makes videos look 10x better.\nI pair it with the Aputure LightDome II, which makes for an enormous setup, but it’s all worth it for the sake of video quality.\nBuy\n\nYouTube Studio Gear (2019) – $7k Setup\nThe A7iii paired with the Sony 24mm GM lens produces absolutely incredible video quality, at a total cost of around $4,000. Adding in the extra lens, and the audio and lighting equipment, makes this kit come to around $7,000.\nMain Lens – Sony 24mm F/1.4 G-Master\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony 24mm F/1.4 G-Master\nThis is my go-to lens for the ‘studio’ (ie: my living room). Any shot where I’m talking to the camera is shot on this beauty. The F1.4 on full frame gives a ridiculous bokeh, so much so that I mostly shoot at F2.0 which tones the bokeh down a little to make it look a bit more natural.\nThe lens is ridiculously sharp, and I like 24mm as a focal length, as it makes me look like I’m quite close to the camera (which I am), which I feel gives the viewers a more intimate experience. That sounds weird.\nBuy\nMain Camera – Sony A7iii\n‌I still use this today. See my 2021 setup for images and description.\nTravel Lens – Tamron 28-75mm F/2.8\nI still use this today. See my 2021 setup for images and description.\nBuy\nSecond Camera – Sony a6500\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony a6500\nI used this camera as my main YouTube driver from September 2017 – February 2019. Previously I’d been using the (really good) Sony a6000 but the lack of microphone input on that meant it wasn’t great for vlogging and ‘run-and-gun’ filmmaking.\nThese days, my A7Siii has become my main driver, but I still use the a6500 as a second camera angle, or as part of an overhead rig if I need to.\nBuy\nTripod – Manfrotto Befree\nI still use this today. See my 2021 setup for images and description.\nBuy\nMicrophone – Rode VideoMic Pro+\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRode VideoMic Pro+\nSince starting my YouTube channel in 2017, I’ve used a Rode VideoMic Pro (and since 2018, the Pro+) attached to a cheap microphone stand and ‘boomed’ in so that it lies just out of frame above my head.\nRather than connecting to the camera directly, I tend to record audio into a Zoom H5. I then sync audio and video using PluralEyes or Final Cut.\nBuy\nAudio Recorder – Zoom H5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom H5\nI connect my Rode VideoMic Pro+ via XLR to the Zoom H5 to record audio externally. I then sync the audio and video in post using PluralEyes or Final Cut.\nWe also use the Zoom H5 as the main recorder for the weekly podcast that my brother and I host.\nBuy\nKey Light – Aputure 120d Mk II with LightDome II\nI still use this today. See my 2021 setup for images and description.\nBuy\nYouTube Studio Gear (2018) – $3k Setup\nThe gear I used to make YouTube videos in my living room from September 2018 to February 2019. This is also probably a bit overkill for people just getting started, but if you’re willing to invest in some decent gear, you get a lot of bang for your buck with this setup.\nMain Camera – Sony a6500\nWhile I kicked off the channel with the trusty Sony a6000, I decided quite early on to invest in the a6500 (at the time it was around £1,200). This camera propelled the channel from around 1,000 subscribers to around 150,000. The revenues from those increased views have easily paid for the price of this setup, many times over.\nThe main difference between this and the a6000 is the 4k video and the fact that this has external audio input. I vlogged extensively with the a6500 in my final year of medical school, and that would’ve been much harder to do with a camera that didn’t allow an external mic (like the a6000).\nSee images in my 2021 setup.\nBuy\nMain Lens – Sigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN\nI bought this lens in December 2017, and it immediately become my main lens for vlogging and also for studio work. The 16mm focal length is wide enough to easily vlog with, and the f1.4 aperture yields an impressive bokeh / blurry background.\nBuy\nSecond Lens – Sony 35mm f/1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony 35mm f/1.8\nThis was the first lens I got way back in 2015 for my Sony a6000. It’s probably the one I recommend most people get as a starter, because it’s absolutely incredible for portraits of people. I used to take my a6000 (and later my a6500) to almost every social event at medical school, and now I’ve got hundreds of really nice-looking, high quality photos from that time.\nIn terms of video, I used this 35mm lens to film interview segments, but I’d mostly use the 16mm to film me-talking-to-the-camera segments because I prefer it to look like I’m closer to the camera.\nBuy\nStudio Microphone – RODE VideoMic Pro+\nSee my 2019 setup for images and description.\nBuy\nThird Lens – Sony 50mm F/1.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony 50mm F/1.8\nI decided to buy this in Singapore Airport for £250 after trying it out. It became my go-to lens for portrait photography at events etc (although I still think 35mm is a nicer focal length to work with, because you don’t have to be so far away from the subjects).\nI didn’t use this much for video, except to get super close-up shots of tech products, eg: to show a super close-up of me writing on the iPad.\nBuy\nKey Light – Cheap setup with light stand and soft box\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeewer Softbox\nI knew pretty early on that I needed a light to maximise video quality, but at the time I couldn’t imagine the thought of spending hundreds of pounds on a light setup.\nSo I made do with a £50 setup from Amazon, that came with 2 lights, stands and soft-boxes. It worked quite well if I’m honest, and although I couldn’t dim the lights (which would’ve been nice), I could always rotate them so that they wouldn’t hit my face so harshly.\nI upgraded to the Aputure 120D Mk II in late 2018 when these lights broke (a friend dropped the bulbs).\nBuy\nStudio Monitor – SmallHD Focus\nThe annoying thing about Sony cameras is the lack of flip-out screen. Therefore, we need a monitor to see ourselves and make sure things are working.\nI balked at the thought of spending £500 on a screen to just show myself, but it’s easily paid for itself over the course of my YouTube career, by significantly reducing the friction of video production.\nTravel Vlog &amp; Photography Setup\nIf you’re a YouTuber, you’ve got to vlog some time. This is my go-to setup for travel vlogging and photography.\n\nMain Camera – Sony a6500\nMain Lens – Sigma 16mm f/1.4 DC DN\nSecond Lens – Sony 35mm f/1.8\nMic – Rode VideoMicro – I found the VideoMicro to be the perfect balance of ease-of-use, portability and sound quality. And it’s pretty cheap as well.\nDrone – DJI Mavic Pro – No proper vlog setup would be complete without a drone. I got this in December 2017 for my family’s trip to Iceland, and I’ve taken it on every holiday since. It’s been a nice source of amusement and fun for my friends, and I’ve managed to get some pretty solid bangers for videos and for Instagram.\nVlog Tripod – Sirui – Most people use the Job GorillaPod, which I used for ages until I discovered the Sirui. The issue with the GorillaPod is that you have to constantly tinker with it to get it to sit straight, and that’s annoying when you want to plop the camera onto a table and talk to it. The Sirui was perfect for those cases."

    "article_body": "I came across some advice during my early university years that really helped me develop as a person. It went something like:\nWhen you’re early on in your career/life, say yes to everything that comes your way. Later on, only say yes to the things you’re really excited about.\nI can remember various opportunities and events that came up, that I wouldn’t have attended were it not for this piece of advice telling me to say yes to everything. Sure, in hindsight, some of them were a bit pointless. But others led to lasting friendships, business partnerships, inspiration in one form or another, and even a couple of fleeting romances.\nAnother major benefit of saying yes to everything was that it forced me to become more efficient with my studying. When I had 8 events to attend the following week, along with 3 essays to hand in, it forced me to not waste time and to bash through the work so that I could do something better with my time. It would have been so easy to tell myself and others ‘sorry I’ve got too much work, I can’t make it today’ but (for the most part) I managed to avoid that excuse for all 6 years of university – in hindsight, I’m glad I rarely used work as an excuse for not doing other things.\nFinally, and at the very least, saying yes to everything means you end up meeting more people which helps develop your social skills, confidence and charisma. These are skills that help everyone, and that don’t develop when you’re sitting in your room alone poring over some work that realistically, you could have finished in half the time.\nOne of the questions that someone sent in for the 100k subscribers Q&amp;A was ‘what advice would you give to someone just starting university’ and this would probably be it. Say yes to every opportunity that comes your way. You’ll be really glad you did."

    "article_body": "I was chatting with a friend a little while back. He’s a final year medic at Cambridge, goes to the gym like every day, is pretty ripped, plays rugby for the university first team, and is working towards becoming an orthopaedic surgeon in the US. We were discussing techniques and mindsets we’ve found helpful in getting a lot of stuff done in our spare time.\nHe came up with an interesting theory. It went along these lines:\nWe all have a list of things we need to do. There are two ways we can approach this. (A) We can view our to-do list as items in front of us, items that we tackle one at a time head on. Or (B) we can view our to-do lists as burdens that we’re carrying on our shoulders, weighing us down as we go about our day.\nThose who tackle their problems (and by problems, we mean stuff like exams, work etc) approach them with optimism and purpose. They think right, I’m going to do some revision today for my exams, then I’m going to hit the gym, then get home to eat, bash out some more revision and get to sleep by 11pm. They know what they have to do, and are tackling it head on.\nThe other types of people have the same stuff to do, but they’re bearing their problems on their shoulders. They think arghhh I’ve got so much work I need to do, how am I going to find the time, I’ve got exams coming up next week and I feel like I know nothing, there’s no way I’ll have time to go to the gym today…\nWe’ve all probably been both sorts of people at various points in our lives. I certainly have. Some days I wake up feeling energised and optimistic, and get so much done. Other days, I wake up and have that sinking feeling that I’ve got a lot of things to do that day. The difference between these two versions of myself isn’t the number of items on the to-do list, it’s simply the way I choose to approach them.\nSince this discussion with my friend, I’ve started to actively think about my to-do list as items in front of me, rather than items I’m carrying on my shoulders. This simple change (when I remember to do it) makes me more productive, and I feel more in control of my to-do list rather than feeling like I’m drowning in it.\nThought I’d share this in case anyone else finds it useful.\nHave a great week!"

    "article_body": "There’s a good book called Getting Things Done – The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen. It’s widely seen as the bible on productivity.\nThere’s a simple concept in it called the 2-minute rule. It goes something like:\nIf a task will take less than 2 minutes, do it right now. If it will take longer, write it down.\nI think about this several times a day, whenever I notice a dirty mug on my desk, or some camera gear that’s in the wrong place, or if I remember that I had to bank transfer some money to a friend, or pay a bill of some sort.\nEvery time, I feel that moment of Resistance, when I think it’s fine, I can do this later.\nBut sometimes, I remind myself of the two-minute rule. I tell myself that if I could follow this rule consistently, my life would be much more pleasant, and my brain less cluttered with little jobs that detract from the bigger picture.\nAbout 50% of the time, this internal argument works and I get off my backside and do the thing. I’m still working on the other 50%."

    "article_body": "Black Wednesday is nearly here. It’s the first Wednesday of August when doctors throughout the UK start their new jobs. Supposedly, this influx of inexperienced doctors leads to a 6% increase in patient deaths in August… This past week, most of us incoming FY1 junior doctors have had various training events, seminars, shadowing sessions to ease us in to how the hospital works – hopefully this additional training will help when 1st August comes around and we start life on the wards for real.\nAnyway, during our induction period (and indeed, over the past 3 years) we’ve had the chance to speak to lots of current junior doctors. And because I’m a big fan of collecting life advice, I make it a point to ask them for tips for starting life as a doctor.\nThere was one doctor I was shadowing on the Cardiology ward. In between teaching me about the various keyboard shortcuts on the hospital computer system, he made a throwaway comment about junior doctor life that stuck with me.\nDon’t believe the hype. It’s really not that bad.\nThis is the same advice I give to medicine applicants when they ask about what medical school is really like. Or when I speak to GCSE students concerned about the ‘jump’ to A-level and how hard it’s going to be.\nDon’t believe the hype. It’s really not that bad.\nEveryone loves to low-key brag about how hard their lives are, how they’re constantly stressed and busy. This is doubly true in Medicine, where the application, the 6 years of university, and subsequent lifelong career as a doctor gets hailed as the hardest thing anyone can ever do. This leads to profound anxiety amongst applicants and students about whether they’d be ‘good enough’ to ‘cope with the pressures’ of a medical degree and career.\nI don’t yet know how hard life as a junior doctor is going to be. But throughout my time in secondary school, I’d been fed the hype about how hard medical school would be, and it really wasn’t that bad. It was pretty chill and enjoyable really, for the most part.\nI guess I’ll find out the truth across the next few weeks. But in the meantime (and this is probably applicable to many others domains), I think it’ll be helpful to approach this new chapter of my life with the mindset of ‘I can do this’ rather than that of ‘this is going to be so tough’.\nI’ll let you know how it goes \nThis post originally appeared as part of my weekly email newsletter. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

    "article_body": "We had a housewarming party last night – lots of our friends came over and we had lots of chats and snacks, and played around 3 hours of Avalon.\nPaul, one of my closest friends from university and one of the smartest people I know, came up to Cambridge for the party. He’s started as a junior doctor as well, working and living in London now. I asked him how work was going (a pretty standard topic of conversation these days) and he replied with it’s busy, but it’s really fun.\nHe explained that because it’s so busy, the time flies – the hospital has pretty bad signal and so when he checks his phone at the end of the day, his messages come flooding in and he’s always surprised that it’s 6pm already.\nBut he said that the reason he describes it as really fun is because that’s the story he wants to tell himself about it. In a way, the more he talks about how much he loves his job, the better he’ll feel about it internally.\nThis is profound, and applies to so many things in life.\nObjectively, the experience is what it is. But the way we feel about it depends to a large extent on the story we tell ourselves. When people ask us, we could say it’s busy and stressful (negative) or we could say it’s busy but fun (positive).\nEspecially given that we’re right at the start of our medical careers, choosing to have a positive outlook is so much… nicer… than choosing the negative one. It lifts the tone and energy of the conversation, it makes both parties feel good, and it makes us focus on the good parts rather than ruminate about the bad ones.\nA cynic might say that we’re lying to ourselves if we say that our jobs are fun. But I prefer to think of it as cognitive reappraisal. We’re taking the objective reality of the situation, and we’re choosing to tell ourselves (and others) the story that makes us feel good. And feeling good about the job makes us more likely to be nicer to patients, to be friendly with our colleagues and ultimately, to be happier about this journey that we’ve worked towards for many years.\nThe same applies to most things in life – if we’re doing something we’ve chosen to do, we might as well choose to be positive about it.\nPS: If this concept of cognitive reappraising stuff was vaguely interesting, you should read The Magic of Thinking Big. I absolutely love that book, and it’s always on the recommended reading lists of successful entrepreneurs.\nPPS: The job is actually quite fun. But even if it wasn’t, we would still benefit a lot from actively focusing on the positives rather than complaining about the negatives.\nThis post originally appeared as part of my weekly email newsletter. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

    "article_body": "I want to talk about a simple change I made to my nighttime routine that’s changed the game for me. It came about after I skimmed through ‘Why we sleep’ by Matthew Walker, a book that was doing the rounds on tech/entrepreneur recommended reading lists recently.\nAnyway, the simple change is that I’ve stopped taking my phone into bed with me. Instead, I leave it on charge across the room, and the only device I have next to my bed is now my Kindle Paperwhite.\nThis has a few benefits. Firstly, when the phone alarm goes off (usually at 6:30am so I can hit the gym before work), it requires me to physically get out of bed to turn it off, which decreases my odds of hitting snooze and going back to bed.\nSecondly, it prevents me from mindlessly scrolling through Instagram/YouTube before bed, an activity that used to add at least an hour (often a lot more) to my bedtime, while not really adding any value to my life.\nThirdly, it means that the only entertainment I have while lying in bed alone () is my Kindle, who I named Arya after my favourite characters in Game of Thrones, Pretty Little Liars and Eragon.\nHaving Arya to keep me company means that I get at least 30 minutes of reading done each day – sometimes fiction (currently Crazy Rich Asians #2 by Kevin Kwan) and sometimes non-fiction (currently ‘Atomic Habits’ by James Clear) depending on my mood. Whether I’m reading fiction to wind-down or non-fiction to get inspired/learn new stuff, it’s a tonne more value than I get from scrolling through attractive people in exotic places on Instagram.\nAnd finally, I’ve found that reading before bed helps me get to sleep. I just read until I notice my eyes start to close, at which point I rapidly remove my glasses (and fold them in a single, fluid motion), place them on the bedside table, chuck Arya onto the floor beside me, and roll over into a deep blissful sleep.\nThis one simple act has thus been a game changer in my nighttime routine. Thought I’d share it here for fun.\nHave a great week!\nPS: If you don’t have a Kindle, I would implore you to invest in one (preferably with this affiliate link). It’s literally the single purchase that’s added the most value to my life, by a long mile.\nPPS: If anyone cares, my morning alarm is ‘Everything has Changed’ by Taylor Swift (ft. Ed Sheeran) and has been since the song came out in like 2013. I think I’ve developed some sort of Pavlovian response to it, because as soon as Ed says ‘we good to go?’ in the intro to the song, I jump out of bed like Mrs Norris being electrocuted.\nThis post originally appeared as part of my email newsletter that I send out every Sunday. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

And that’s simply to start them a week early.\nThe problem with New Year’s Resolutions is that we give them far too much weighting in our collective culture. It feels a ‘big deal’ to make a vow to ourselves that we’ll do this ‘big’ thing from January 1st and keep it up for the whole year.\nIf however, we start on 23rd December, it feels like less of a big deal and more like a simple change we could really have made whenever we wanted.\nThis has helped me stick to a few different resolutions over the years, although admittedly I’ve still got plenty that have fallen by the wayside.\nPS: If you’re reading this not-in-the-New-Year-period then you can really start your New Year’s Resolutions whenever you want  Why wait until the end of the year to make a change?"

    "article_body": "On the flight home from Sudan this week, I read an absolutely wonderful paper from 1989 called The Mundanity of Excellence – An ethnographic report on stratification and Olympic swimmers.\nThe author breaks down (in a very readable but rigorous fashion) the differences in daily habits, practices and mindsets between swimmers in different fields of competition (from local club competitions all the way up to Olympic level).\nI’d recommend making the time to read the whole thing (it took me around 30 minutes) but here’s a quick summary of the main points:\n1. Excellence is a qualitative phenomenon\nIntuitively, we tend to think of excellence as a quantitative phenomenon (he must work so much more therefore he gets better grades or she must put in so much practice, that’s why she’s so good). Instead, the author argues that excellence (in any field, not just swimming) is much more about the qualitative differences – a slightly different approach to training, a different variety of techniques etc.\nThese small changes, when compounded, lead to excellence. Excellence isn’t just a result of working harder, it’s a result of working smarter in small, very achievable ways. Nothing novel about this conclusion of course, but the way the point is made in the article is well worth visiting.\n2. The concept of ‘talent’ is useless\nAscribing ‘natural ability’ or ‘talent’ to someone’s excellence is a lazy way of saying ‘we don’t know how they did it’. The author argues that if we took the time to study how they did it, we’d find a specific set of practices that we could (if we wanted to) apply to our own lives to get similar results.\nIn the mystified notion of talent, the unanalysed pseudo-explanation of outstanding performance, we codify our own deep psychological resistance to the simple reality of the world, to the overwhelming mundanity of excellence.\n3. Excellence is mundane\nThis is the main point of the article. There’s nothing ‘special’ about high performers. They just have a set of habits, practices and mindsets that individually aren’t particularly groundbreaking, but when added together and compounded over a long period of time, result in the phenomenon of excellence. It’s all very mundane.\nBut of course, there is no secret. There is only the doing of all those little things, each one done correctly, time and again, until excellence in every detail becomes a firmly ingrained habit, an ordinary part of one’s everyday life.\n\nThe article is quite an inspiring read, and the general message that anyone can be ‘excellent’ with the right set of habits (rather than excellence being granted a mythical, unattainable status) is one that we’d all benefit from hearing more often."

    "article_body": "I’m writing this post from a small town in Sudan where some other doctors and I are helping out with a medical mission running pop-up clinics in local villages (PS: check out the pics on Instagram).\nWhen I’m in new situations like this, my default state is to stay in my own head and feel hesitant to talk to people. But there’s a little quote that I like to tell myself that goes along the lines of:\nPeople are friendly, but you have to go first.\nWe had a 90-minute coach journey to one of the villages earlier today. I was initially sitting towards the back with some of the #lads who I got on with quite well. Then around halfway through the journey I reminded myself of the ‘go first’ rule and plucked up the courage to wander down the bus and speak to other groups of students, introducing myself and trying to learn some Arabic pickup lines.\nI ended up making some new friends, and the rest of the day running the clinic in the village was much more enjoyable because I had built some rapport with the students on the journey there.\nI’ve found that this go first rule works wonders for my self-confidence in lots of domains, from meeting new people on a Sudanese bus ride to initiating banter with senior doctors at work. So if you, like me, sometimes find yourself in situations where you’re a bit hesitant to put yourself out there, you might find the quote helpful to remember.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnjoyed this post?

    "article_body": "In my tech review videos, I sometimes talk about The Value of Delight. It’s the idea that spending extra money to get an more delightful experience can be ‘worth it’ if it encourages us to do more of the thing we want to do.\nI’ve noticed the concept in more areas of life too. For instance, I wrote the first draft of this on my Leuchtturm 1917 notebook with a Pilot V-ball pen. Writing on this notebook is a delightful experience, which encourages me to write more which is a Good Thing. I’m editing the draft on Notion, an organisation / project management app – Notion is such a delight to use that it encourages me to use it more, which encourages my own productivity and creativity which is also a Good Thing.\nFor the past few months, I’ve also been using Superhuman, an incredible email app that costs a completely absurd £30/month to use. It’s such a delight to use that I’ve replied to twice as many emails as I was doing when using free or cheaper alternatives – again, overall a Good Thing.\nI’m more than happy to pay for all these services because of the value of delight. If an app costing $40/year is such a delight to use that it encourages me to use it even 10% more than the free equivalent, that extra 10% will compound massively over the long term. I’d end up getting far more than that $40 of value out of it.\nI know plenty of students who get triggered at the thought of spending £24 on Anki, a flashcard app that they’ll be using for their exams for years. They’d blow that same £24 on a ‘night out’ that (a) they’ll forget, and (b) that’ll cause them to be so hungover that they’d skip lectures the following day, in their university degree that costs £9,000/year.\nA few years ago, I would think twice before buying apps and books that cost £3-10. I would think ‘ahhh do I really need this’ and ‘I’m sure I can find a free pirated version if I look hard enough’. Later that day I’d blow the same amount of money on a Starbucks or a random takeaway that I really could’ve done without. My stance has now changed completely – I view (useful) apps and books as investments with a potentially huge return, and I think my life has improved as a result.\nBasically, if an app is helping me do something productive / useful / fun, and paying for it gives me a more delightful experience that encourages me to use it more, it’s totally worth it.\nPS: I’m not advocating spending money on apps/books if you can’t afford it. I’m advocating for prioritising buying useful apps and books over coffee and takeaway"

    "article_body": "A couple weeks ago I sent an email asking you guys to send in snippets/quotes that have helped you in your own life. This week, I want to feature one of the responses from a guy called George who studied at Oxford for 3 years and is now applying to graduate-entry Medicine.\nFrom 2015 – 2018, I found myself gradually developing some sort of Oxbridge imposter syndrome (aside from other mental health issues), feeling like a bit of a failure and perhaps a bit unintelligent, and like I was letting myself and my family down by not coping very well or understanding things fully. Whether it be my tutors, or my peers who ‘claimed’ to be struggling just as much as I was, I felt constantly surrounded by people who were far brighter than me, who could grasp new concepts much quicker than me, and who seemed to need less support.\nGeorge came across the following quote that helped at the time:\nThis advice gives a nod to the Beginner’s Mindset, an idea that I’ve found quite helpful over the years.\nThe Beginner’s Mindset is, well, the mindset of a beginner. When you’re a beginner in anything, your ego doesn’t get in the way. You know you’re just starting out and probably aren’t very good, and that’s okay because you’re a beginner and you’re there to learn. You work hard to improve, you actively seek out advice from people who are ‘better’ or more experienced than you, and you never feel bad about your inadequacies because, well, you’re a beginner.\nI find that adopting this Beginner’s Mindset is useful in almost every domain of life, not just those in which we’re legitimate beginners. A beginner’s mindset means that when we’re in a supervision or seminar with our own peers, but we don’t understand something that everyone else seems to, we have no qualms about speaking up and asking for clarification. It means that when we’re studying with friends, we’re not trying to prove our intelligence or knowledge in any way – we’re simply there to learn. And it means that we don’t feel bad if others are ‘better’ than us, because we can learn from them and actively improve ourselves.\nThere are always going to be people who are smarter, faster, stronger than we are. Having a Beginner’s Mindset approach to life means that when we come across these people, rather than feeling inadequate, we rejoice at the opportunity to learn from them and better ourselves.\nHave a great week!\n\n\n\nThis post originally appeared as part of my email newsletter that I send out every Sunday. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

Whenever I was in my room during waking hours, I’d leave the door propped open and occasionally, when people would walk past on their way down the hallway, they’d pop in for a chat.\nBecause of this liberal open-door policy, my room became an informal hang-out zone for my friends, and over the next 6 years, was often the default venue for group study sessions.\nMany of my happiest memories from university were a result of the serendipitous meetings that happened as a result of the open-door policy. Had I kept my door shut while I was in (as most students tend to do by default), I probably would’ve been a bit more productive in terms of studying, but at the cost of missing these moments that I now look back on with fondness and joy.\nI’ll leave you with this quote that I came across in a Farnam Street article this week:\nWorking with one’s door closed lets you get more work done per year than if you had an open door, but I have observed repeatedly later those with the closed doors, while working just as hard as others, seem to work on slightly the wrong problems, while those who have let their door stay open get less work done but tend to work on the right problems! I cannot prove the cause and effect relationship, I only observed the correlation. I suspect the open mind leads to the open door, and the open door tends to lead to the open mind; they reinforce each other. (Hamming, Richard R..

    ],
    "article_body": "As you might know, I’m a big fan of productivity, consistency, discipline and buzzwords. Often however, I find myself in a place where I can’t fully enjoy myself because I have a certain guilt hanging over me that I should be doing something ‘productive’ instead.\nI’d like to propose a (not at all) novel way of dealing with this. I call it The Reitoff Principle.\nThe Reitoff Principle\nI’ve got several friends who (used to) routinely go out drinking and partying and stuff on Saturday nights. I’d often hear them say ‘Sunday’s a complete write-off’, and I’d silently judge them for wasting away valuable days of their life lying in bed with a hangover.\nI now think there’s definitely something to be learned from these alcoholics. When they actively decide that a day is going to be a write-off, it gives them the mental space to enjoy themselves guilt-free. It means that they don’t procrastinate from having fun because they’re concerned they should be doing something more useful instead.\nThese past 10 days, I’ve had several Reitoff days – last Thursday, I decided to go to the cinema by myself after work and watch Captain Marvel, then on Monday night we spent the evening eating takeaway burgers and watching the latest episode of Game of Thrones (which was awesome, obv), and then the following evening we watched Avengers: Endgame until 2am (also awesome, obv). I did literally nothing productive on those 3 days, and it was great.\nApplying the Reitoff Principle\nWhen following a diet, often people will schedule a cheat day where they can eat whatever they want. This makes it easier to follow the diet on every other day – you’ve got the cheat day to defer your trashy food to.\nThe Reitoff Principle should work in the same way. From now on, I’ll be more intentional about which days are going to be Reitoff days and which are going to be normal (hopefully productive) days. If there’s a day where I get home from work a little late and I’m feeling pretty tired, I’ll just write-off the evening and lounge on the sofa reading a book or getting through my backlog of Peter McKinnon and Matt D’Avella videos, completely guilt-free.\nBut on days where I’ve got plenty of time and energy to crank out a video or blog post, I’ll devote 100% of my attention to that, and hopefully avoid the procrastination trap.\nI’m not sure if this will even work. Even as a self-professed internet productivity guru, I struggle with motivation, discipline and consistency from time-to-time.\nBut that’s why I love trying out new methods for hacking my brain – these all work towards the timeless goal of being able to act in our long-term interests while also enjoying ourselves.\nI hope this unnecessary-and-pretentiously-named Reitoff Principle will be another arrow in my quiver, on the quest to conquer the monkey mind. Maybe you can try it out too and let me know how it goes."

    "article_body": "I’ve been on-call as the psychiatry junior doctor this weekend. That’s involved leaving home at 8am each day and returning around 10:30pm each night. This is rather a large chunk of the day spent ‘at work’ and yet I managed to get a lot of side-hustle stuff done (writing, planning videos etc).\nThe reason is productive downtime. When I’m at work, especially on-call, there are often long periods of downtime. In fact, I can sometimes go 2-3 hours without getting a single call. Since I started using an iPad, my downtime in moments like this has been much more productive.\nIt’s not that there’s a major difference between an iPad and an iPhone – you can basically do the same things on both, and especially if you connect a bluetooth keyboard to an iPhone, you can probably be just as physically productive.\nBut at least for me, there’s a big difference in mindset. To me, the iPhone is very much a consumption device. I browse instagram, watch YouTube videos, read articles on Reeder or Instapaper, or if I’m really stuck into a book, continue reading it on the Kindle app. These are all consumption activities.\nWhen I’m on the iPad though, I have a much more creator mindset. Even though the operating system is identical to my iPhone (for now), I find it much easier to plan out videos in Notion, write stuff for the blog in Bear, update my to-do list on Things and update my Second Brain in Evernote.\nMost of us probably find it easier to study in the library than in our bedrooms. This context-switching helps shift our brains into different gears. I suspect a similar thing is happening when switching between the iPhone and iPad.\nAnd sure, I get that the luxury to switch between these two devices shows how enormously privileged I am etc etc. But I think that even without fancy tech to play with, we can all figure out what environments and contexts we work best in. Having identified that, we can then work with our psyche to get stuff done, rather than fighting an uphill battle in the never-ending quest for productivity."

    "article_body": "At the start of this week, I found myself feeling a little overwhelmed. I’d been on holiday over the Christmas period, and on returning to the UK I had two back-to-back weeks of 13-hour shifts at the hospital. In that time, various things had piled up in my email inbox and my to-do list. To sort through this mess, I used a productivity trick that sounds simple but is incredibly effective – I asked myself the following question:\nWhat’s the one thing I can do today that’ll take the largest load off my shoulders?\nI triaged my to-do list based on this one-thing-per-day principle. And each day for the last week, I did just that – one thing. Now it’s the end of the week, and my mind genuinely feels lighter than it has in ages because I’ve bashed through the tasks that were weighing me down.\nSo that’s the message of today’s post – if you’re struggling with a long list of tasks, don’t try to be a multitasking productivity master. Just do one thing per day, starting with the one that’s causing the most angst, and your spirit will be free.\nThat’s the end of the useful bit of this post, but if you fancy reading about my to-do list this week, here it is.\nMy to-do list\nOverall, I didn’t get as much done on Wednesday to Friday as I would’ve liked, but I accomplished my one thing per day most days so that’s a win.\nMonday – Updated the 6med website with our BMAT and UCAT course dates for the year. This just takes a few hours of work each year, but because it’s quite boring, I always put it off until we start getting frantic emails and phone calls from parents desperate to book their kids onto one of our (amazing) courses.\nTuesday – Wrote up the plan for a Quality Improvement Project aimed at improving the way FY1s (ie: the most junior doctors like me) are trained to respond to cardiac arrest calls. Sent this to two colleagues and the consultant supervising us.\nWednesday – Filmed and edited 2 videos, and replied to all my outstanding emails to schedule sponsored videos for the next 1-2 months. I had the day off (because I’m working on the weekend) so I probably could’ve done more, but oh well.\nThursday – Intended to film another video, ended up being a wasteman and just playing some piano and guitar in the evening after work.\nFriday – Filmed a video, edited another one. Probably could’ve done a lot more if I’d been more efficient, but enjoyment is just as important as efficiency in my book.\nSaturday – 8:30am-9:00pm shift at work. By about 7pm there was nothing left to do on the ward, so I bashed through a tonne of patient data for an audit about the management of high-grade Ovarian Cancer. Sent it off to the supervisor with a feeling of relief as this had been looming over me for 2 weeks.\nSunday – 8:30am-9pm shift at work. It’s currently 3pm and I’m writing this post in my lunch break. That’s the one task for today \n\nEnjoyed this post?

    "article_body": "You’ve probably heard of Stephen King. He’s like, the world’s most best-selling author of all time. He apparently attends lots of writers conferences where he does Q&amp;As. Sometimes, a young, well-intentioned, budding new writer asks the question Mr King, what pencil do you use?\nThis question makes him sigh. The pencil isn’t important. The notebook isn’t important. What’s important is the writing. And using the same pencil as an author you admire won’t make your own writing any better.\nThis is a story that I have to remind myself of on a weekly basis. As a tech enthusiast, I’m always looking for that next product or that next app that’ll change the game and 10x my productivity, or efficiency, or video-quality.\nAnd there’s a place for that – clearly, a decent camera will make my videos better quality than a less good one. But I’d argue that in most cases, the equipment doesn’t matter. That moleskin notebook won’t make us any more productive. That new iPad won’t make our revision any more efficient.\nEspecially when we’re starting out in a new endeavour, we should probably care a lot less about finding the perfect equipment, and focus a lot more on just doing the work.\nPS: I can’t remember where I first came across this story, but I was recently listening to Seth Godin’s podcast Akimbo where it came up again. I stopped my skateboard (because I skateboard to work like a baller), got out my phone and wrote it down. This is another wannabe-life-guru tip – write stuff down when you come across interesting ideas \nUnrelated Reading\nNon-Fiction – I recently finished reading The Courage To Be Disliked by Ishiro Kimichi. It was an interesting introduction to Adlerian psychology, and there are a few good lessons that I’ll take away from it. Not the best self-help book I’ve ever read, but a pretty solid read regardless.\nFiction – I’ve just started the audiobook (via Audible) of The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. I needed something to fill the hole left by Patrick Rothfuss’ Kingkiller Chronicles and a few people suggested Sanderson’s The Stormlight Archive series. Absolutely loving it so far. Definitely a much denser read than the Mistborn series, but still a joy to listen to.\nThis post originally appeared as part of my weekly email newsletter. Click here to check out the previous issues and maybe subscribe"

    "article_body": "If there’s one thing I’d recommend you buy/request as a gift over the Christmas period (or anytime really), it’s an Amazon Kindle Paperwhite. This is not a sponsored post (I wish) but does include some affiliate links as usual \nHere are some reasons why you should get a Kindle.\n(1) It massively reduces the friction for reading.\nIt’s pretty uncontroversial to say that reading a book is probably better for us in the long term than scrolling through Instagram. The problem is that scrolling through Instagram when we’re commuting or in bed is just too easy. Having a Kindle on our bedside or in our bags makes it much easier to ditch the scrolling and to become engrossed in a good book.\nThe Kindle mobile app is also pretty good, so on occasions when I don’t have my Kindle with me, I just carry on reading on my phone (which syncs seamlessly with the actual Kindle so I don’t lose my place).\n(2) It massively reduces the friction to getting a new book.\nWhen I hear a book recommendation on a podcast or blog, I instantly hop onto Amazon on my phone and buy the book on Kindle and can start reading it within a few seconds. I don’t even look at the price, (a) given how cheap books are, and (b) the ridiculously high ROI (return on investment) that’s possible with them.\nFor example, Tim Ferris’ 4-hour work week was a big contributor to my entrepreneurial endeavours, and allowed me to build a company in medical school that’s been doing 6 figures in revenue for 5 years. Not bad for a book that costs £7 (although admittedly, I think I torrented a PDF of it in secondary school, sorry Tim).\n(3) Kindle highlighting is incredible\nYou can use the touchscreen to highlight whatever you want, and then you can browse through your highlights on any device to remind yourself of your favourite quotes/lessons.\nYou can even sign up to an app like Readwise that sends you a daily email with 5 of your Kindle highlights – this has been one of my favourite discoveries of 2018. In fact, while reading my daily Readwise email on the toilet a few minutes ago, I came across a passage from Make it Stick that’s going to be super helpful for my upcoming video about how to learn new content for the first time \n\nSure, a Kindle doesn’t quite give you that romanticised experience of ‘reading a physical book’ that everyone loves to go on about, but I think that the benefits far, far outweigh the lack of that ‘hardback book aroma’ and ‘the feeling of a book in my hand’.\nSo yeah, overall, my Kindle has been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made. The books I’ve read on it have added an enormous amount of value to my life, and I can’t recommend it highly enough.\n\nEnjoyed this post?

    "article_body": "In Atomic Habits James Clear writes about Keystone Habits – small choices that lead to a cascade of other actions.\nFor example, when he and his wife get home from work, they either (a) immediately change into their gym kit, or (b) sit on the sofa. Their evening changes based on this decision.\nIf they change into their gym kit, they’ll inevitably end up going to the gym that evening then cooking something healthy for dinner. If they sit on the sofa instead, they’ll inevitably end up watching Netflix and ordering Indian takeaway. The healthier habit just requires making one small decision (gym kit vs sofa) and the rest takes care of itself.\nI’ve noticed a few keystone habits in my own life, and I’m working on identifying more. For one, these days I wake up at 6:15am and make myself a Nespresso. Then I either sit on the dining table with my iPad Pro, or I sit at my proper desk with my laptop + big screen setup in front of me. If I go down the iPad Pro route (as I’ve done this morning), I open up Ulysses and start writing something, or open up Day One and do a quick journal entry while drinking the coffee. If however, I sit at my desk, I inevitably end up opening YouTube, realising there’s a new Peter McKinnon or Becki &amp; Chris or Matt D’Avella video and the rest of the morning is gone.\nAnother example – I try to think about getting to bed between 10:30-11, and the keystone habit that makes this possible is brushing my teeth. As soon as I brush my teeth, the rest of my night-time routine automatically follows and I end up in bed reading on my Kindle until I feel tired enough to fall asleep. But the longer I delay brushing my teeth, whether I’m sitting chatting to my housemate, or working on a video edit, or just wasting time on YouTube / Instagram, the later I’ll end up going to sleep.\nBefore reading Atomic Habits I guess I knew about this stuff somewhat intuitively, but as is often the case, giving something a name (Keystone Habits) helps draw our attention to it when we see it happening in our lives.\n\nEnjoyed this post?

    "article_body": "This week, I met up with a chap called Chris. He’s of the Acute Medicine Consultants at my hospital. Some friends and I are working with him on a Quality Improvement Project to improve the way junior doctors at my hospital respond to cardiac arrests.\nWe shared our thoughts about how to analyse the data, and discussed the changes we might make to make junior doctors more comfortable with holding the Crash Bleep, the pager that goes off whenever there’s a cardiac arrest that we have to run to.\nWe wrapped up with an action plan – stuff that we’re going to be doing to move things forward over the next few weeks. As we were working through some of the finer details, Chris advised us to keep Parkinson’s Law in mind.\nParkinson’s Law states that work expands to fill the time allocated to it.\nAlthough our true deadline for completing this project is many weeks or even months away, having such a long time to do the work is actively unhelpful. We’d put it off for ages, then we’d run into logistical issues, then some of us would be on annual leave, all while the very idea of doing the work would be a weight on our shoulders.\nInstead, he suggested, we should give ourselves a self-imposed deadline of 3-7 days to complete the next steps of the project. This would avoid unnecessary time wasting, and ensure we actually get the important stuff done.\nParkinson’s Law is useful to keep in mind in any endeavour that requires some level of work. That work will always expand to fill the time we allocate to it. In my school and university days, when I’d give myself a whole day to get an essay done, that essay would end up taking the whole day. If however, I had social/sports stuff that day and only 2 hours to work, I’d get the essay done in that time. I suspect there wasn’t much difference in quality between the two.\nEqually, when I give myself a whole morning to film a video, it inevitably ends up taking the whole morning with multiple takes and a tonne of procrastination. If instead I just allow myself 30 minutes to film, I naturally get it done much faster and there’s legit no difference in quality between the two modes of operation.\nI came across Parkinson’s Law many years ago when I first started reading books about productivity. I hadn’t really thought about it for a while though, so it was useful to have the reminder from Chris to apply it to our Quality Improvement Project. I’ve now started actively thinking about the Law more often whenever I need to get something done (including this email). Hopefully you’ll find it useful too.\n\n‌Enjoyed this post?

    ],
    "article_body": "The idea of setting up a personal blog has been swirling around in my head for some time, but I’ve never before managed to shake the nagging suspicion that to write about my own experiences, ideas, life etc, would be unbelievably narcissistic and should therefore be avoided at all costs.\nHowever, I recently came across Derek Sivers via the Tim Ferriss Show (great podcast btw), and he referenced the book ‘Show your Work’ by Austin Kleon. So because of that book, and because the New Year is a great time for starting new things, I’ve decided to kick this blog off with a somewhat meta post attempting to convince myself that blogging is a good idea.\nI’ve structured it as a listicle because that means I don’t have to spend too much time thinking about structure, and can spend that time catching up on the Medicine work I should have been doing over the Christmas break.\n\nNo one will care what I have to say\nI’m not good enough to write about this\nPeople will think I’m really self-centred if I’m writing about my own life\n\nSo let’s address these concerns in turn, and attempt to come up with some kind of justification for why they’re invalid. Before doing so, a quick disclaimer: The responses you’re (hopefully) about to read are by design, very specific to my own circumstances. I hope that some readers will be able to draw parallels with their own lives, and may perhaps move a step closer to sharing their own work/ideas, but if anyone’s looking for a proper convincer, please do read ‘Show your Work’. That said, let’s jump straight into it.\nConcern 1: No one will care what I have to say\nThis concern naturally stems from the general insecurity that what we have to say isn’t interesting to anyone else. I mean, who would care what some random 20-something has to say about anything at all?\nThe ‘correct’ response to this concern is probably along the lines of ‘it doesn’t matter if no one else cares, because you should write for yourself!’. While this response has its merits, it wasn’t what personally convinced me. Instead, I read somewhere that you should ask yourself the question ‘will this be interesting/useful to at least 1 person in the world?’. If the answer is ‘yes’ or ‘maybe’, then you should share what you have to say. If the answer is ‘no’, then you’re probably more justified in holding back, or keeping the post private.\nThe impulse to keep to yourself what you have learned is not only shameful, it is destructive. Anything you do not give freely and abundantly becomes lost to you. You open your safe and find ashes.\n-Annie Dillard\nLet’s take this particular post as an example. Will it be useful/interesting to the majority of people? Unlikely. But will it be interesting/useful to at least one person in the world? Hopefully. I mean, there must be at least a few people who’ve been thinking of setting up their own blogs, and if this post goes even an inch towards convincing them to take the plunge, it’s worth it. And if absolutely nothing else, I imagine a few of my friends/family would be interested to read it. So that’s reason enough to write it.\nConcern 2: I’m not good enough to write about this\nExpanding on this slightly, one might be inclined to comment I’m not good enough at / experienced enough in / knowledgable enough about x to be able to write about it publicly, let alone give others advice about it.\nThe simple response to this is that you don’t need to be an expert/professional to share work you’ve done, lessons you’ve learnt, experienced you’ve had etc. Kleon explains this point beautifully in the chapter entitled Be an amateur. He quotes Clay Shirky’s Cognitive Surplus:\nOn the spectrum of creative work., the difference between the mediocre and the good is vast. Mediocrity is, however, still on the spectrum; you can move from mediocre to good in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something.\nKleon then goes on to say:\nAmateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing… [They] might lack formal training, but they’re all lifelong learners, and they make a point of learning in the open, so that others can learn from their failures and successes.\nLet’s add another quote to the mix, this time from C.S.Lewis:\nIt often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can. The fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten.\nAnd finally, yet another quote that ends Kleon’s chapter:\nThe best way to get started on the path to sharing your work is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others… Be on the lookout for voids you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first. Don’t worry, for now, about how you’ll make a career off it. Forget about being an expert or a professional, and wear your amateurism (your heart, your love) on your sleeve. Share what you love, and the people who love the sae things will find you.\nThat’s a lot of quotes (and again, I urge you to read the book, but the point I took from it was that it doesn’t make any difference whether you’re an expert or a beginner in the field you write about. Experts can write for both beginners and other experts, but amateurs/beginners can write for other amateurs/beginners having learnt something interesting/cool, and can often explain that concept better than an expert could.\nConcern 3: People will think I’m really self-centred if I’m writing about my own life\nThe first thing to say about this is, of course, that the vast, vast majority of people don’t think about you at all, let alone think that you’re a douche/self-centred/narcissistic. Eleanor Roosevelt has been quoted on this topic so often that, somewhat ironically, I almost feel bad about quoting her here:\nYou wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realized how seldom they do. -Eleanor Roosevelt\nSecondly, provided what someone has written is at all interesting/useful, why on earth would anyone think badly of them for writing it? I personally read too many blogs about design/tech/medicine and various other things, and not once have I thought ‘Wow, this writer is a self-obsessed, narcissistic piece of **** for writing this!’. I imagine most readers feel the same way about the stuff they read.\nFinally, for the sake of argument, let’s assume that a few people do end up thinking you’re self-centred. The obvious response is ‘So what?’. A legion of books and articles has been written on the topic of ‘Stop caring about what others think’, so I won’t even try to expand on the point – it’s an important one to make nonetheless.\nClosing Remarks\nSo there we have it. This post hasn’t attempted to touch on the numerous benefits of writing, nor has it tried to make anything close to a comprehensive case. Instead, I’ve reflected aloud about 3 concerns that I needed to address in my own head before committing to this whole personal blogging thing.\nOf course, having said all of the above, on some level I think I’m also doing this in that hope that if someone does think I’m ridiculously self-obsessed for having a personal blog, they’ll see this post and change their mind. We all have our struggles.\nAnd for the last time, if you’re even remotely interested in learning more about the virtues of sharing your work/ideas/method, please read ‘Show your Work’ by Austin Kleon."

    "article_body": "I was having dinner with a friend recently (let’s call her Annie), when conversation turned briefly to a mutual acquaintance (let’s call her Jane). Annie voiced an issue she had with Jane, paraphrased loosely as:\nI don’t like Jane. I saw her in the corridor the other day, and smiled at her, but she completely blanked me in front of her friends. I gave Jane loads of help when she was applying to Cambridge, but she probably feels she’s too cool for me now, and decided to ignore me around her friends. What a bitch.\nAnother example, this time John expressing his dislike towards Martin.\nI don’t like Martin. The other day, there was a group of us hanging out, and he made several jokes at my expense. I’m normally okay with having the piss taken out of me for banter (that’s what we lads do after all), but Sophie was in the group too, and Martin probably knows that I like Sophie, so he was trying to lower her image of me so that he could go for her instead. What a dick.\nAnd a third, just to beat a dead horse further. This time, it’s from my own life (just in case y’all thought I was perfect).\nI don’t like Rose. The other day, I was organising a pizza night for a university society, and was trying to get people to attend. Rose, who’s attended several events in the past and seemed to enjoy them, decided to invite her friends to a Chinese restaurant instead, at the same time! I don’t know what I’ve done to her to make her hate me so much!\nWe all fall into this pattern of thinking from time to time. We take an event and we tell ourselves a story about it that makes us out to be the victim and a third-party to be the malicious perpetrator.\nWe fail to realise that the person we perceive to be the aggressor is a human being (like us) who (like us) has good intentions 99.9% of the time. We don’t consider the hundred different reasons for their ‘bad’ behaviour towards us, instead choosing to tell ourselves the version that (a) makes us feel terrible, and/or (b) paints the other person in the worst light imaginable.\nWe might scoff at such platitudes, insisting that we, from our endless experience of being slighted, have magically developed the ability to ‘understand other people’. We might think that we are of the enlightened few who truly realise just how awful people can be, and that believing the worst of others is obviously the best way to protect ourselves. And worse still, we might gleefully ‘share the news’ with our circle of friends (for their own protection of course), looking for validation for our feelings, that so-and-so is a ‘nasty person’ and that ‘she’s like that with everyone’.\nBut if we do so, we create resentment that festers in our hearts. We spread rumour and gossip, we spit on the character of our fellow human amongst their peers, and for what? For the sake of a few minutes of vicious backbiting, based on a likely innocent event that our own psyches are embellishing to cause the most damage? Even if we keep our anger and resentment to ourselves, it tends to accomplish absolutely nothing, other than adding negativity and ‘bad mojo’ to our own lives.\nAs the Buddha is often misquoted as saying:\nHolding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die\nSo what should we do instead? Well, the next time we feel anger/annoyance towards someone for something they’ve ‘done to us’, we should stop and think. We should realise that our anger is coming from the story we’re telling ourself about the event, not from the event itself. We should do our fellow human the courtesy of considering alternative explanations for their behaviour, explanations that don’t have to paint them as the bad guy and us as the innocent victim.\nIf we all did this more often, then maybe, just maybe, the world would be a slightly kinder place. We wouldn’t assume malice where none exists. We wouldn’t interpret an acquaintance failing to return our smile as she thinks she’s too cool for me when she didn’t see me is far, far more likely. We wouldn’t vilify our friend for knowingly stealing our girl when we’ve never once told him how we feel about her. And we wouldn’t view I don’t like pizza as she hates me and is trying to turn everyone against me.\nHamdun al-Qassar, one of the great early Muslims, said:\nIf a friend among your friends errs, make seventy excuses for them. If your hearts are unable to do this, then know that the shortcoming is in your own selves.\nThese days, whenever I find myself on (or beyond) the verge of speaking ill of someone else, I try to remember the quote. I try to come up with 70 excuses for their behaviour, and normally only get to 2 or 3 before realising that there are kinder ways to view the situation. I tell myself that if I were in the other person’s shoes, I’d probably have acted the same way for entirely innocuous reasons. I think of (a modified version of) Hanlon’s Razor, another massively useful principle:\nNever attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by neglect, misunderstanding or just busyness.\nFurther Reading\nMy thoughts on this topic are hugely shaped by Derren Brown’s brilliant book Happy – Why More or Less Everything is Absolutely Fine. He writes about this topic in depth, exploring how we have a tendency to ‘add to first impressions’, ie: how we embellish stories about events to make ourselves feel as bad as possible, and uses some insightful and quite entertaining examples (much better than the ones I’ve used above). I’d highly, highly recommend the book for anyone even vaguely interested in how to live a happier life, and if you’re the sort of person who thinks ‘lol i’d never read a book about happiness’, then you’re also probably the sort of person who’d benefit most from it.\nAlain de Botton (sick guy) has a great book too, called The Course of Love. In it, he describes a love story between a gentleman and a lady, from before they meet to many years into their eventual marriage. Throughout the book, wherever there’s strife between man and wife, Alain interjects with his commentary, suggesting reasons for both parties’ thoughts and actions, and showing us just how much pain can be caused by simple misunderstandings, and about the importance of communication in relationships. As corny as that sounds, it’s really a wonderful read, and if you’re in, or vaguely interested in being in, a relationship, you’ll find it very interesting."

Even though it sounds like straight out of a fortune cookie, realising that we (and no one else) own our time is a very powerful thought.\nIf we take this thought, we can no longer say I don’t have time. The truth is we simply choose one thing over the other and so if we’re not having time for it it means that it’s just not a priority.\nFor example, earlier today I decided to play World of Warcraft for 6 hours (game with me on Twitch?) instead of working out (in case you’re wondering why six pack abs is still on my goals list ). I could say I don’t have time to work out but the truth is I chose not to work out and game instead.\n\nWhatever you’re doing right now is the best use of your time, according to you.\n— Sahil Lavingia (@shl) April 16, 2021\n\nSo, the #1 step is to realise that we’re always in control of our time. Therefore, if we want to make something happen, we need to make it a priority and not fall for cheap excuses.\n Hell yeah or no\nThis is a very simple mental model coined by Derek Sivers, the author of Anything You Want – one of the three books that most changed my life.\nIn his other book called Hell Yeah or No Derek shares a mental model that helped him (and now me and hopefully you) make better decisions. When we’re young there’s more value in saying yes to various opportunities. But as we progress in our career, we start getting more and more inbound requests. This can easily result in a flooded inbox, crammed calendar, and no quality time for ourselves.\nThe way to counter that is by making decisions with a Hell Yeah or No maxim in mind. If a new opportunity – meeting, course, business – makes us say Hell Yeah, I want to do that! then we should go for it. But if our response is anything below that including Maybe… I have to think about it we should just let it go.\nPersonally, I try to get better at using this mental model as even these days I have events on my calendar that I don’t feel really excited about. Yet, with enough practice, I hope to have a fully Hell Yeah calendar in no time.\n The daily highlight\n\nThis is a time management tip straight from my favourite productivity book Make Time by John Zeratsky and Jake Knapp. The idea of a daily highlight is that we choose one specific task that we want to get done during the day. This simple technique works because it saves us from an overly long to-do list and analysis paralysis.\nI know that on days when I set a daily highlight I almost always get it done. Whereas on days where I have no clear priority, I often switch between various tasks not getting that much done.\nIn fact, I first started using this tip back in 2019 (which I shared in one of the issues of my weekly newsletter) and I’ve been using it constantly ever since.\n ​Use a to-do list\nOur brains are for having ideas, not for holding them – David Allen, author of GTD\nIt’s so easy to forget about things we needed to do or an idea we had. Therefore it’s crucial to have a way to store them. The way I do it is by using a to-do list. These days, I use two tools to get my to-do list system running. For capturing tasks and ideas, I use an app called Roam Research while for my daily to-do lists I use a physical Analog Starter Kit from Ugmonk.\nThere are two reasons for using this combo:\n#1 I need a quick and safe way to store tasks and ideas that randomly pop up in my brain. That’s why I use Roam here.\n#2 Having a physical to-do list in front of our eyes without having to use an app is simply a pleasant experience. Plus, crossing tasks off the list brings the feeling of satisfaction that you don’t get with a digital to-do.\n\nTo be honest, it really doesn’t matter what app you use. I often find myself defaulting back to the basic Apple Reminders app – as long as I’ve got a place to store todos for myself, I’m happy.\n Time blocking\nThis time management tip (as well as the next one) is something that apparently Elon Musk uses on a daily basis.\nTime Blocking = Whenever we have a task to do we should put a time block in our calendar just for this thing – it really is as simple as it sounds.\nPersonally, I prefer to use this technique in combination with the daily highlight. I first choose the one thing I want to get done on a particular day and then block out time in my calendar just for this thing.\nI don’t use time blocking for every single thing. As the old maxim goes – The time you spent prioritising/organising your work is time you aren’t spending doing it.\nBut, in combination with the daily highlight, time blocking makes it much more likely that we’re going to get it done. And, of course, on most days we have to do more than just one thing. But imagine if, for the next year, you’ve managed to do this one, most important thing every day. Wouldn’t it lead to more progress?\n⏳ Parkinson’s Law\nParkinson’s Law states that work expands to fill the time we allocate to it.\nIf we give ourselves a week to write a paper, it’ll likely take us a whole week. This is the idea of Parkinson’s Law which states that work expands to fill the time that we allocate to it. But what if we gave ourselves only 2 days? It turns out that with this time constraint we’d likely get it done in 2 days.\nAs I’ve mentioned before, this tip is also used by Elon Musk who sets himself incredibly short deadlines so even if he doesn’t finish the whole task he’s still way ahead with the progress.\nTo take advantage of Parkinson’s Law we need to leverage artificial deadlines. Even if we’re not pressured with an external deadline, setting one will help us get the task done. For example, I’m currently working on another Skillshare course. This is an optional project that I chose to do and with no fixed deadline I might never get myself to finish it. So, instead, I decided to schedule it for next weekend and get it all filmed by then.\nIf you’d like to explore more laws of productivity including my own Productivity Equation, check out my Productivity Masterclass on Skillshare. It’s free for the first 2 months and you can watch hundreds of other classes on productivity, filmmaking, and cool stuff.\n Protected time\nWith the growing number of connections and people who want to ‘have a chat’ it’s hard to have time just for yourself. One way to get that time back is to set Protected Time. It means no meetings, Zoom calls, or tasks scheduled during this period.\nThese days I set my protected time for the first 4 hours of my mornings and I use it to write my book.\nIn fact, if you’d like to follow my journey of becoming a writer, you can sign up for the Book Journey newsletter. Over there, I share all of my ups and downs, progress (or regress), and generally what it takes to write and publish your first book.\nAnd even if I’m not working on my book, it’s genuinely pleasant to have a couple of uninterrupted hours in the morning when I can do business planning or, if I’m not really feeling it, play World of Warcraft or read a book.\n Delegation\nWhen most people hear about delegation their instant response is I don’t have enough money. And I get it. It’s a valid concern. The way I got over that doubt was by setting a fixed hourly rate. A dollar value of my time.\nBack when I was starting my first business, I decided that an hour of my time would be worth $20. If something could be delegated for cheaper, I’d use services like Fiverr to hire freelancers who were more than happy to do things like data entry or video editing. This way I got more time to do high-impact things for my business and personal life.\nFollowing the delegation principle, I recently hired a cleaner which got me a couple more hours that I could spend, for example on writing this article.\n Automated scheduling\nWith different time zones and personal preferences, scheduling a single meeting can take up to 20 minutes spread over several days. At some point, this became too much trouble so I decided to try out some kind of scheduling software. I went with the most popular choice – Calendly – and my life was never the same . In all honesty, scheduling meetings, Zoom calls, and virtual hangouts with friends have been so much easier since then.\nIn the beginning, it might feel weird to send someone your Calendly link and let them choose a time and date. But then, when someone sends me their Calendly link I’m always grateful as I know how much time and effort it saves me.\n The choice to be satisfied\nThe last tip is more philosophical. For us productivity nerds, who are into getting stuff done it’s easy to feel dissatisfied at the end of the day. We look at our to-do list that’s still full of tasks we were supposed to do. At that point, we can either stress out about the things we haven’t managed to do or choose to be satisfied with the work we’ve done.\nEither way, it’s a choice that we have to make and just like with choosing to own our time (Tip #1) here we’re also the owners of the decision. After all, feeling bad about not having done stuff is not going to help in any way. On the other hand, being satisfied will likely have a more positive impact on our behaviour and future performance.\nConclusion\nWith these 10 time management tips, you should be able to regain control of your time. Going back to the opening thought – there’s only so much time in a day so it’s worth doing everything we can to use it to the fullest.\nAlso, if you prefer video over text, you can check out the video I made on How I Manage My Time.\n\nLastly, if you enjoyed this article, you might want to sign up for my weekly newsletter – Sunday Snippets.

    "article_body": "We don’t rise to the level of our expectations/hopes, we fall to the level of our training. – Archilochus\nI came across this quote a few days ago, and it really resonated with me, so I thought I’d write this. I tend to come across quotes/cliches like this quite frequently, and given that the secrets to life are hidden behind the word cliche (another of my favourite quotes), I plan to do a brief write-up expanding on quotes that have particular meaning to me. So here goes.\nThis quote by Archilochus makes a lot of sense, and like most good quotes/life advice, seems quite intuitive. Some might even scoff at its simplicity – those same people would also probably scoff at most ‘cliched’ ‘life advice’, so this post isn’t for them \nAnyway, the quote reminded me of my Fourth Year OSCE exams. For the uninitiated, OSCEs are Objective Structured Clinical Examinations, a type of medical school (and beyond) exam in which students have multiple ‘stations’ to get through, each of which has a different task. For example, one station might be to break bad news to a patient (an actor), another might be to ‘perform a cardiovascular examination on this patient’ (read: listen to their heart), and a third might be to interpret some X-rays with the examiner.\nGiven that this year’s OSCE was 4 days after the written exam paper, lots of students (including me) decided to focus on the written exam, and then in the 4 day interim, do intensive preparation for the OSCE. That worked for a lot of people, but I wasn’t overjoyed by my own OSCE performance, and I think the quote goes some way towards explaining why.\nIn essence, I didn’t practice the OSCE stuff much throughout the year, only really doing token amounts of work towards it, and instead focusing almost single-mindedly on the written paper. This was a mistake – the OSCE accounts for 50% of our overall grade (the written paper making up the other 50%), and OSCE-related skills (history-taking, clinical examinations, clinical communication skills etc) make up an enormous chunk of a doctor’s workload.\nI can remember thinking in those 4 days of intensive OSCE preparation that (a) I wish I’d done more of this stuff throughout the year, and (b) hopefully in the exam, everything will go according to plan. In the exam, everything did not go according to plan, and while I performed reasonably, there was a lot of room for improvement.\nIt’s very easy, while practising a skill that we haven’t fully mastered, to think through the steps in our heads and assume/hope that they’ll translate into practice if we carried them out in real life. But as we were told at the start of the year, there’s no substitute for sustained practice over a long period of time (a patient a day keeps failure away), and that’s what I’ll be keeping in the back of my mind for the next 2 years of medical school.\nWe don’t rise to the level of our expectations/hopes, we fall to the level of our training. – Archilochus"

    ],
    "article_body": "These days it’s harder than ever to stay focused. We’re surrounded by fancy technologies and the whole new (and usually more fun) world is just a stone’s throw away.\nAnd, let’s say it up front, there’s nothing wrong in scrolling through your Instagram feed or playing Dark Soul for a few hours (guilty ).\nIt becomes a problem when these things become distractions from the work that we want to do. We all have goals, deadlines, and dreams that we chase. And without deep work and plain manpower put into these projects, none of it is going to happen.\nSo today we’ll break distractions down into simple pieces so you’ll get to know exactly why we’re getting distracted in the first place to then discover how we can fight these distractions and finally learn how to stay focused.\nWhy we’re getting distracted\n It’s too boring\nThe #1 reason why we give in to distractions is that the work we’re doing (or want to do) is too boring – it’s as simple as that.\nA lot of activities that are generally good or healthy end up in the boring category when compared to fun, dopamine-led distractions. When it comes to making a choice, we’ll always lean more towards the fun over boring.\n It’s too hard\nThe second reason is that we turn to distractions when we hit a major roadblock while doing the work. Often it’s a combination of frustration and long hours spent on trying to crack that one mistake or step of the task that’s just taking too long.\nWhen this happens it’s basically an open invitation to all distractions that are laying around.\n It’s too prominent\nSometimes we make it too easy to get distracted.\nIf the work is too boring or too hard then we have to fix the thing that we’re working on.\nBut, if we keep our smartphones a foot away from us, knowing that every single notification might turn our attention to an hour-long distraction then we’re making it too prominent and the thing that needs to be fixed is the distraction itself.\nHow to stay focused\nOkay, now that we know the enemy, it’s time to give it the Dementor’s Kiss. \nWe’ll explore 5 different techniques that I use to stay focused and hopefully, after you read the whole piece, at least one of those will become your go-to cure for distractions.\n Embrace Welcome Distractions\nIt might sound counterintuitive but you should embrace a specific type of distraction and use it to your advantage.\nWhat we’re talking about here is the distinction between welcome distractions and unwelcome distractions.\nA welcome distraction would be:\n\na close friend coming to talk to you\na phone call from a loved one\nWarm sunshine that makes you take a look outside the window\n\nAn unwelcome distraction would be:\n\na notification on your phone\nan unexpected phone call from your bank\nloud noises from right above your apartment\n\nA welcome distraction is something that you should be looking forward to – an activity that brings joy and added value to your life. Sure, it’s still a distraction but given that it’s genuinely good for you, you should treat it as a break from your work.\nWhen I was at the university, it was easy to drown yourself in exam material and study for long hours every day. To fix that unhealthy habit, I decided to use a doorstop to keep my door open so whenever I was studying in my room, my friends could come in and hang out for some time.\n\nIt did stop me from working which probably resulted in a 0.001%-worse grade but oh well, you’ve got one life. After all, when you’re on your deathbed you won’t regret that you haven’t stayed focused 24/7 but rather the fact that you prioritised work over relationships.\nAnd the key to making it work is to know which distractions bring you tangible value (embrace those) and which are essentially time-eaters that bring nothing to the table and stop you from doing valuable work – get rid of those.\n Optimise For Enjoyment\nNow, we’re directly tackling the first two reasons why we’re getting distracted in the first place. That’s if our work is too boring or too hard.\nOne way to fix it is by gamifying the process and making your progress more visible which then should encourage you to take the next step. If you’re a bit of a nerd like myself and you’ve played a lot of RPGs then you know this feeling of satisfaction that you get with each new level earned. And, in the game, everything you do has a reflection in your so-called XP (the experience you earn) so you get that urge to play even more and level up even faster.\nGamifying the real-life work can make it much more satisfying and easy to go through. When you’re studying for an exam and you have a whole workbook to go through, it feels like a hard sell. But, if you divide it into smaller bits and track your progress over time (visually) then you’ll be tempted to do the next one and the next one until you finish the whole thing.\nIn fact, I have a whole video on how to study for exams where I explain my Traffic Lights method which helps you track your progress and make the whole learning process fun and enjoyable.\n\nThese days my hard-sell task is writing a book. So, instead of thinking about it as 300 pages that I need to write, I go chapter by chapter, idea by idea, tracking it all in Notion and making daily progress that I can track and look back on whenever I feel like there’s just no progress.\nIf you want to follow my book writing journey I have a dedicated newsletter just for that. So, if you fancy becoming my book-writing buddy, hit the subscribe button below.\nAll in all, whatever your work is – learning how to code, writing a book, working on some business idea – give yourself these little milestones that will help you visibly track your progress. Simply, ticking off one task from the list will make the whole process more satisfying and before you notice, you’ll have a whole tracking system that you’ll enjoy going back to whenever you finish another part of your project.\n Throw Away the Phone\nOur smartphones are easily the most attention-grabbing devices out there. And because they’re always only a few inches away from us it’s easy to get sucked in. A constant stream of notifications and some potential unexpected calls don’t make things easier.\nWhenever I have something important to do I simply put my phone a few feet away from my desk. This way I don’t get bombarded with notifications and there’s no urge to pick it up and start scrolling through Instagram or Twitter.\nAlthough usually I simply put my phone face down and turn on airplane mode. For some reason when I don’t see the screen there’s less temptation to pick it up and start procrastinating. And since it’s on airplane mode no notification or unexpected call is going to interrupt me.\nSo, if you know that your smartphone plays a big role in your ability to focus, turn on airplane mode, put it a few feet away from your workstation so you won’t randomly glance at it and enjoy distraction-free work time.\n Control your Environment\nRemember the third reason why we’re getting distracted? It’s too prominent. When our environment is messy and a lot of things fight for our attention it’s really easy to channel our attention to one of these distractions when our work becomes too hard or too boring.\nThe 21st-century work environment is usually a desk and the simplest tip would be to keep your desk clean and simple. Who would have thought, right?\nIt’s a simple rule but one that I find really hard to follow so my desk usually looks like this \n\nTo make my desk distraction-free I usually follow a 2-minute rule:\nIf a task will take less than 2 minutes, do it right now.\n2 minutes is usually not enough for me to clean all the crap that I piled up over the last couple of days but even a slight cleanup can lower the number of distractions and the likelihood of my mind wondering what’s that lens doing or how about I play with that fidget cube?\n\nNo matter if you’re working from a desk or your workplace is much more complex than that, do your best to keep it clean and simple. Strip it down from all unnecessary additions and make sure each thing that’s there adds value work-wise or enjoyment-wise. But if anything becomes a distraction just get rid of it. No hard feelings.\n⏳ Deliberately Manage your Time\nThere’s one more part of the work process that we can free from distraction and that’s our calendar and how we’re planning and scheduling things.\nIn his book Indistractable, Nir Eyal points out that often you can tell how prone to distractions someone is only by looking at that person’s calendar. If there are a lot of empty and unplanned spots, there’s a higher chance that you’re not going to do any deep work as your mind will focus on the low hanging fruit which is usually some kind of entertainment.\nOn the other hand, once we get deliberate about our time and start to plan things ahead, it’s much more likely that we’re going to do these things because we now have a plan. Therefore, once it’s go-time, you know exactly what to do.\nA few productivity techniques that you may find really helpful are time blocking and daily highlight.\n Time blocking – For any task that you want to do, put a time block (fixed amount of time) in your calendar. This way you end up with blocks of time in your calendar which leaves no room for wondering what to do or for how long you should work on any given task\n\n Daily highlight – Set one thing for a day that you want to get done. One reason why we find it hard to sit down and do the work is analysis paralysis caused by an overly long to-do list. So, once you decide on one thing that you want to get done (above all else) it’s much easier to start doing the work which is usually the hardest part.\nAnd I’d actually recommend you combine both of these techniques so in addition to time blocking your tasks you should also choose one that you want to prioritise above everything else.\nIf you’re already using these techniques or simply want to explore more ways in which you can efficiently manage your time, I have a video with 10 Time Management Tips which you can look up down below.\n\nConclusion\nDistractions are an inevitable part of our lives and, in fact, I don’t think getting rid of your phone or giving up on your gaming console is a way to go. A much better solution would be to control our environment, plan our day ahead of time, and shut down all distractions while working.\nAlso, if you’d rather watch a video, you can check out this clip on Why You’re Always Distracted (and how not to be).\n\nLastly, if you enjoyed this article, you should check out my weekly newsletter – Sunday Snippets.

    "article_body": "It’s been an exciting start to the New Year. I’ve decided to take blogging more seriously. I’m making progress towards getting six-pack abs. And our team behind the business (and this website) has doubled in size.\nManaging our team of 8 people and getting them aligned with the company mission and goals has been an interesting challenge. As usual, to help guide my approach, I turned to my medium of choice, books. This time on team management.\nI picked up a few well-known titles including my favourite to this day, The Making of a Manager by Julie Zhuo. One concept that seemed to stand out in a lot of different resources was the idea of Self-Management.\nSelf-Management skills help us take control of our actions, through accountability, productivity and motivation. Team members who have these skills theoretically need less ‘management’ from their boss.\nInterestingly this applies as much to team management as to personal development. Whether we want to be an A-level employee, an A* student or a successful entrepreneur, we all need self-management skills to achieve our goals.\nBut because, for most of our early years we’re constantly guided by teachers, we rarely get to learn these skills, and we almost never think about deliberately improving them.\nSo, in this post, we’ll talk about the most essential self-management skills, complete with examples, strategies, and rules that we can apply to get better at self-management.\nWhat Are Self-Management Skills?\nSelf-management includes all the skills that help us control various aspects of our life. This includes the choices we make, our reactions and our ability to prioritise and control our feelings or thoughts.\nDeliberate self-management lets us take control of the trajectory of our life. Broadly, we need to think about 2 things – (1) coming up with a plan, and (2) sticking to it. Without these, it’s hard to achieve any personal goals.\nEven if we’re not so keen on achieving personal goals, self-management is what all employers will be looking for in new hires. With more companies going remote, people with good self-management skills are more likely to do their job properly without being constantly watched.\nFor example, on The A Team (that’s what I call our team lol), everyone handles a certain part of the business. They hold themselves accountable with very little management on my side. Or at least, I hope that’s the case.\nFrom an employer’s perspective that’s a much more pleasant experience. In this scenario, I can try to create meaningful relationships with team members rather than be a stereotypical boss who micromanages every employee.\nSo, no matter which side you’re on – working on your own or being an employee – self-management skills will determine whether you can achieve the goals you chose.\n7 Essential Self-Management Skills\nThere are tens if not hundreds of self-management skills but we don’t need to actively work on that many to be effective in what we do.\nHere are 7 self-management skills that I found most useful in both my personal and business life.\n Organisation\nYour brain is for having ideas, not for holding them – David Allen\nOrganisation is the backbone of the rest of our self-management stack. Why?\nWell, although our brains are complex and beautifully designed, they’re better used for thinking than storing. Sure, we might remember our 7th birthday party but we’ll have a hard time recalling what we ate for breakfast three days ago.\nThe real ‘trick’ to being more organised is to therefore offload the storing functionality of our brain to external systems. This is a central philosophy in David Allens’ Getting Things Done – he’s big on the idea of Project Lists.\nMy friend Tiago Forte takes David’s ideas a step further, with a comprehensive system for Personal Knowledge Management called Building a Second Brain.\nIt’s beyond the scope of this post to talk about the organisation systems in-depth, but broadly, we need:\n\nA way to capture ideas, todo items and open loops\nA way to keep track of the projects we’re working on\nA system for storing and retrieving our notes, highlights, quotes and artefacts of work\n\nIn practical terms, this usually involves using: (1) a calendar (I use Fantastical), (2) a todo list manager (I use the Analog system by Ugmonk), and (3) a central note-taking app (I use a combination of Roam and Notion).\n\nOnce we’ve built an organisational system into our lives:\n\nWe’re less likely to forget stuff\nWe’re less likely to have things slipping through the cracks\nOver time, we’ll build a library of our notes and learnings over the years that we can use as tools for reflection, or for making more stuff\n\nIf you’re looking for inspiration on how to set up such a system for yourself, here you can see how I use Notion for note-taking. And for systems to organise your life, take a look at how I do it with Roam Research.\n Goal Setting\nIn the world of productivity nerds, there’s a constant raging debate on systems vs goals. The pro-goals agenda talks about the power of setting SMART goals, and how that can help us move towards a better future. The anti-goals brigade talks about how goals are pointless without the systems that help us get there. After all, you don’t run a marathon by setting a goal to do so. You run a marathon by signing up to one, training every day, and then showing up to run the race.\nThis debate is somewhat pointless (and in fairness, I’m misrepresenting it above). The real answer is that both goals and systems are useful.\nGoals are our compass. They help point us in the right direction. Systems help us move forward in the direction that we set with our goal.\nI’ve recently rediscovered the power of goal-setting. In fact, I’ve started documenting my goals each month on this very website.\n\nI’ve realised over the years that I love goals that are broadly within my control, and I hate goals that are outside of my control.\nFor example, publishing 2 videos per week is a goal that’s very much within my control. But reach 2M subscribers on YouTube is a goal that’s very much outside of my control. Equally, write and publish a book that I’m proud of is within my control. But land a spot on the NYT Bestseller List is mostly out of my control.\nWhen I’m setting goals, I like the vast majority of them to be within my control (usually ‘input’ goals) rather than outside of it (‘outcome’ goals). Sure, part of me wants to hit the NYT bestseller list with my book. But a bigger part of me wants to enjoy the journey rather than being fixated on the destination, and I know that I have much more fun when the goals I set are in my sphere of influence.\nIf you’re interested, you can download a Notion template that I use each year to reflect on the past year and set goals for the next one. Try it out yourself and if you get lost, check out my video with a walkthrough of the template.\n⏱ Time Management\nTime is our most valuable non-renewable resource.\nThere are only so many hours in a day and so mastering the self-management skill of time management pretty important if we want to do lots of cool stuff. People often ask me how I balance being a doctor and running a YouTube channel. Here’s a quick 10-point list that I elaborate on in my video.\n\n3 Principles of Time Management\n\nOur time is our own – When we ‘don’t have time’ to do something, it really just means that it’s not a priority for us. At any moment, we’re doing the thing we most want to be doing.\nThe Pareto Principle – 20% of the inputs drive 80% of the outputs. If we can focus on that crucial 20%, we’ll have a tonne more time on our hands.\nParkinson’s Law – Work expands to fill the time we allocate to it. Is it really going to take 4 hours to do the thing? What if we only had 2 hours to do it? Would we get it done then?\n\n3 Strategies for Time Management\n\nThe 2-Minute Rule – If something’s going to take less than 2 minutes to do, do it right now.\nBatching – Batch multiple instances of the same thing together. Eg: check email once or twice a day, and deal with it in a batch, rather than checking it every 10 minutes.\nWatching TV – This one’s a bit controversial. One of my best-kept secrets to time management is that I have a simple rule for myself: I’m not allowed to watch TV on my own. Watching TV is either a social exercise (with friends), or it doesn’t exist.\n\n3 Tools for Time Management\n\nAlfred – This is a fantastic tool for shaving off miliseconds from every interaction we have with a computer. Here’s a post where I explain it in more detail.\nForest – This is a fancy pomodoro app timer. I used to use it a lot when in university. I don’t so much anymore.\n10-Fast Fingers – This is my favourite website for practising my typing skills.\n\n\n Self-Motivation\n\nI used to have problems with ‘motivation’. I don’t anymore, because I’ve tried to internalise the notion that motivation is a myth. In fact, I think we’d all be much happier and get much more done if we scrubbed the word motivation from our vocabulary altogether.\nHere’s a quote from one of my favourite articles on the subject:\nMotivation, broadly speaking, operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task.\nPut simply, motivation is waiting until you feel like doing something before doing it. Discipline on the other hand, is doing it regardless of how you’re feeling about it. Here’s another fun quote:\nAt its core, chasing motivation is insistence on the infantile fantasy that we should only be doing things we feel like doing. The problem is then framed thus: How do I get myself to feel like doing what I have rationally decided to do?. Bad.\nThe proper question is How do I make my feelings inconsequential and do the things I consciously want to do without being a little bitch about it?.\nI return to this article several times a year to remind myself of its paradigm-shifting lesson. Jeff Haden writes about something similar in his book The Motivation Myth.\n\nThese days, the only circumstance in which I let myself even think about motivation as a concept is if a friend is complaining ‘aarghh I just don’t have the motivation to work right now’. If I don’t know them very well, I reply ‘yeah me too lol’.\nIf however, I know the person well, I give them an unsolicited lecture about exactly why motivation is a myth, and why/how they should be cultivating discipline. If they’re still in the room by the end of this conversation, they usually think ‘wow you’re right, I shouldn’t be trying to feel like doing stuff, I should just do it!’\nSo overall, motivation is a myth. Trying to get yourself to feel like doing something useful is a fool’s errand. A 3-year old bases their day-to-day decisions on what they feel like doing. An intelligent student/adult recognises that feeling like doing something useful should have absolutely nothing to do with whether they actually do it.\n Stress Management\nWhile stress shows up in different ways for different people, managing stress and being able to move on when something isn’t going our way is an important part of living a happy and fulfilled life.\nI’m quite lucky, in that I almost never get ‘stressed’. I sometimes struggle to relate to the feeling. I like to think it’s because I’ve internalised the teachings of Stoicism, so very little fazes me. In reality, I probably got quite lucky with a mixture of personality + environment + privilege to be in a place where I rarely feel stress.\nThe Stoicism stuff is definitely a part of it though. For example, one of the key ideas of Stoicism is that It is not events that concern people, it is their judgements concerning them. This is incredibly powerful when we can apply it to our life.\nDerren Brown’s Happy is one of my favourite introductions to the topic. Or if you like, you can check out my Skillshare class where my friend Sam and I discuss the principles of Stoicism that have changed our lives and help us deal with stress.\n Accountability\nWhen we’re unable to do a job as planned, instead of facing the consequences we tend to grab for the low-hanging fruit, an excuse.\nOne study found that 66% of academic students would create an excuse to get an extension on their assignment rather than admit to their mistake. While this statistic isn’t shocking to anyone who’s spent some time at university, the same study found that this statistic doesn’t change when we alter the weight of the assignment. Namely, no matter if the assignment equalled 5% or 40% of the final grade, students were equally keen on making excuses.\nWhy is that a thing? Well, it’s more convenient to turn to out-of-our-control sources and use those as an answer for why we failed. If we fail it’s other people’s fault, bad luck, or awful weather (greetings from the UK ). Yet, when we win it’s our preparation, skills, and hard work that, of course, this time paid off.\nIt’s a convenient approach but also the one that’s doomed to failure.\nThe power of accountability is what separates wantrepreneurs from actual achievers. Without it, we won’t get consistent results with any goal that we want to achieve. It’s also what makes us trustworthy in the eyes of other team members, our employer, or our fellow students.\nTo take a personal example – through my first 2 years of being a junior doctor, I made plenty of mistakes. But each time, I’d explain the situation to my seniors, apologise for the mistake on my part, and figure out how I could learn from the experience. I’ve never had a negative response to that approach.\n Meaningful Productivity\nSo we’ve figured out our goals, we’ve created systems around them, and we’ve incorporated them into our pixel-perfect schedule. At this point, we just need to execute on our marching orders, preferably in an efficient fashion, while enjoying the process.\nThis is where the self-management skill of productivity comes into play. Productivity is about making the most of our time or, put more specifically, creating a certain amount of meaningful output over a certain period of time.\nI like to think about productivity through the Productivity Equation.\n\nMastering the skill of productivity is really about finding what you want to do and then creating a system that may include all sorts of rules, hacks, and tricks to get it done sooner rather than later.\n5 Ways to Improve Our Self-Management Skills\nIf you’ve read this far, a lot of this self-management stuff might feel intuitive. Yeah of course, we should be more organised, and more productive, and take responsibility for our actions.\nBut it’s one thing knowing that we should, and another thing entirely to deliberately practise the skills of self-management. Here are 5 things we can keep in mind to boost our self-management skills.\n Choose to be Satisfied\nWe can’t stay productive all the time or completely stick to our schedule 24/7. That’s okay.\nI’m sad that I have to say this, but it’s okay to take some time to recharge. We shouldn’t beat ourselves up if we’ve ‘wasted’ a few hours. No one cares, in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAt the end of the day, you don’t have to beat yourself up. You can choose to be satisfied with how you spent your time.\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) January 25, 2021\n\n⌛ The 2-Minute Rule\nThere are many spin-offs of the 2-minute rule but the one I use for more productivity and accountability states that:\nIf a task will take less than 2 minutes, do it right now.\nIf it’ll take longer than 2 minutes, I tend to write it down on my todo list (I use a combination of paper + Roam Research for this). Right now, I’ve got a load of random crap on my desk, including 2 coffee mugs, a done candle, and a load of books I was using for thumbnails yesterday. It would take less than 2 minutes to clear everything up, and it would drastically improve my quality of life to have a clean desk while writing this.\n\n Strive for Consistency\nLife is a marathon, not a sprint. We don’t want to use all our energy on a Monday to end up a slump for the next 6 days.\nInstead of looking for these rare bursts of energy, we should focus on 1% progress each day. This is something that James Clear teaches in Atomic Habits. There’s no need to do our best all the time. If we can be good every day, we’ll get much further compared to someone who goes all in and burns out.\nConsistency is more important than intensity.\n Stick To The 2-Day Rule\nThis is a fun idea that I first discovered in one of Matt D’Avella’s YouTube videos. The 2-day rule is quite simple and, just like its 2-minute sister, aims to help us build momentum and stay mindfully productive.\nThe 2-day rule states that:\nYou won’t allow yourself to skip a goal/habit/activity for two days in a row.\nLet’s say we want to get better at time management. And, let’s assume this means filling out our calendar and then sticking to it the next day. We might allow ourselves not to stick to the schedule for one day, as long as we show up the next day.\nThis approach is much healthier than a rigid-but-wishful I’ll do everything I planned hack. This way, we introduce room for mistakes (which will happen) but without sacrificing the end goal.\n Take Advice from Self-Management Experts\nThe good thing about trying to achieve a goal is that, most likely, someone has already done it. So, instead of running blindfolded and hoping for the best, we can use the advice from those who’ve already got to where we want to be.\nAs always, my favourite format for getting almost any advice is books. For under $15, we’re getting years (if not decades) of research and wisdom condensed into a format that’ll take us a few hours to read or listen to.\nTo get some inspiration, check out my Book Notes where I share books I read with a some notes and a quick summary of each.\n\nConclusion\nSelf-management is one concept that can help us achieve our personal and business goals. While it’s no easy job to develop these skills, it’s totally worth it, and has the potential to drastically improve our lives.\nIf you’re ready to commit to levelling up your productivity – one of the core self-management skills – check out my free Productivity Masterclass on Skillshare. I cover all sorts of things that I learnt and applied over the years, including tips, hacks, apps, and principles that helped me get where I am."

    "article_body": "Let’s be honest – we’re all using computers on a daily basis and most of us use it for work. And while I don’t want to admit it, I spend the majority of my time in front of my laptop writing blog posts, emails, and consuming content.\nThese days we use computers for everything. From entertainment to consuming content to working, we spend hours each day typing on keyboards in favour of pen and paper. Because of that, improving your typing speed is one of the most impactful things that you can do to level up your digital productivity.\nAnd I genuinely believe that anyone can become twice as productive solely by learning how to type faster.\nPersonally, I’ve been learning how to type faster since I was 13 and these days I type with an average typing speed of 155 words per minute (WPM) while the average typing speed is around 45 WPM. And professional typists’ speed (whoever they are) is usually around 90 WPM.\nSo, in this article, we’re going to lay out 8 actionable tips that you’ll be able to implement right away to type faster. These are the same steps that I took (and refined) several years ago which helped me increase my typing speed from regular 60 WMP all the way to 155 WPM.\nAnd, in case you’re not completely sold on the idea of spending time learning how to type fast, we’re going to kick things off with 3 main benefits of having a fast typing speed.\nThe benefits of fast typing speed\n You’re more productive at a computer\nThese days most of our work revolves around computers and therefore around typing on a keyboard. If you can increase your typing speed to the point where you can type equally fast as you’re thinking then you’ll at least double your output.\nAnd it doesn’t only apply to work-related things. You’ll get faster at responding to your friends, browsing the web, and going through the files on your computer. Essentially, time savings everywhere.\n It encourages creativity\nThe closer your typing speed gets to your thinking speed the more creative you become. When there’s no gap between you wanting to type something and actually doing it, you don’t interrupt the stream of thoughts.\nAnd that’s especially helpful when you’re writing things like blog posts, email newsletters, or video scripts. Usually, when you’re writing a first draft, you want it to be messy and to include all of your thoughts, notes, and ideas so staying in the uninterrupted flow state is key. And fast typing speed is a crucial component to get there.\nPeople often ask me how I manage to do a lot of things seemingly at the same time – work as a doctor, run a YouTube channel, write on my website – and apart from standard productivity advice that I share, learning how to type faster is one of the reasons I’ve been able to do that. It’s a huge time saver and it’s key to efficient computer usage.\n It impresses people\nFunnily enough, the most common compliment I got while I was working as a doctor was Wow! You type really fast. Sure, maybe that’s not the best compliment that you want to get as a doctor but hey, I’ll take that.\nIn all seriousness, fast typing is a great conversation starter and when someone sees you blast out 155 WPM, you’ll definitely draw some attention but in a good sense of that word.\n8 tips to type faster\nNow that you know why it’s worth learning to type faster, let’s go through 8 actionable tips that you can implement right away to level up your typing speed.\n Learn keyboard shortcuts\nThe first thing would be to learn keyboard shortcuts to correct mistakes as it’s likely the most time-consuming thing when typing on a keyboard.\nThere are two shortcuts that are essential for fast typing.\nThe first one is OPTION + BACKSPACE on Mac or CTRL + BACKSPACE if you’re one of those heathens using Windows. This shortcut deletes a whole word so you won’t have to repeatedly tap Backspace.\nThe second shortcut is CMD + BACKSPACE on Mac and SHIFT + HOME &gt; BACKSPACE on Windows. This one deletes a whole line.\nSo, the next time you make a mistake use one of these shortcuts and try to make it a habit.\n Practice on 10fastfingers.com\nI discovered this website when I was 13 and I haven’t found anything better for improving my typing speed. What 10fastfingers.com has to offer is 1-minute typing tests where you try to type as many words as possible without making mistakes.\n\nAt the end of each session, you’ll get your words-per-minute (WPM) score with some additional details like the number of mistakes you’ve made or your accuracy.\nEven if you do these typing tests semi-regularly it will have a serious impact on your typing speed. In fact, one of my teammates, Angus, has run an experiment where he would practice on 10fastfingers once a week for a few months. And after these few months, he improved his typing speed from 65 WMP all the way up to 95 which is quite a lot for just one practice session per week.\n Practice on keybr.com\nKeybr.com offers a similar solution to 10fastfingers but with a twist. Instead of testing you on the 300 most common words in English, it tries to discover your weaknesses and train you on those.\n\nThe way it works is that it first picks a few keys like E, N, I, T, R, and L and then tries to detect if you have problems hitting any of them. If that’s the case, it’ll produce more examples of words (usually made up) so you work on your weaknesses.\nI treat it as an addition to 10fastfingers as I personally prefer to type actual words and typing on keybr.com may get a bit frustrating because it usually makes you type gibberish. But, on the other hand, if you struggle to hit some specific key it might be worth spending a couple of minutes every day drilling it down on keybr.com.\n⌨ Try to use only the keyboard\nIf you want to improve your typing speed and overall digital productivity it’s key to switch to a keyboard-first approach and use your mouse and trackpad as rarely as possible.\nThe reason for that is – it’s simply much quicker to switch between tabs and move on a computer using a keyboard (if you know how to do it) compared to dragging a cursor across the screen. And as a second-order effect you’ll improve your typing speed as you’ll be using your keyboard more often.\nSo, the question is how do we do it right?\nAnd a way to go is to use an app called Alfred which replaces the built-in Spotlight feature on your Mac. You can think of it as Spotlight on steroids. Thanks to it you’ll never go back to manually looking for apps in your doc or using a launchpad view.\nWith Alfred, you can do everything from switching between apps to browsing the web and searching for things on Google.\nFor example, if you want to turn on Spotify all you have to do is click COMMAND + SPACEBAR and type Spotify. Just like using Spotlight.\nBut, if you want to search for a specific book on Amazon you can do COMMAND + SPACEBAR and type ‘amazon Wheel of time’ and it’ll automatically browse Amazon for you. Or if you’d like to quickly google something, use the same shortcut and simply type in your search term.\nYou can also customise Alfred to your liking so it works according to your preferences.\nKeep in mind that if you just start using a new app, it might be tempting to use your mouse but a better way to deal with this new situation is to look for keyboard shortcuts and make it optimal to a keyboard-first approach. And, after a few sessions, it won’t feel intimidating at all.\nAnd if you haven’t found your perfect keyboard, feel free to check out this video I made on The Best Keyboards for Fast Typing. I’ve tried out 6 of the best keyboards that are on the market to find out which one would be the best for fast typing.\n\n Try to never look at the keyboard\nIt’s very tempting to keep your eyes on the keyboard, especially when you’re just starting out with this whole fast typing thing. But… a much better approach would be to make sure you don’t look at the keyboard (at all) and even drop a few WPM to do that.\nThere’s a high chance that you won’t be able to sustain your current typing speed after switching to the eyes-on-the-monitor approach but the whole point of learning to type faster is to never look at the keyboard and focus on what’s on the screen. So trust me, it’s worth the effort.\nAnd after a few weeks of forcing yourself to never look at the keyboard, you’ll develop muscle memory and naturally hit the right keys without ever having to look at them.\nBy the way, I have a whole Skillshare class where I teach you how to Triple Your Typing Speed. You can try it out 100% free for the first month and I might be biased but that’s the most comprehensive guide to keyboard mastery that’s on the web. And since it’s free for the first month and you can check out other classes once you’re there, I highly recommend you give it a try.\n Keep fingers on correct resting positions\nYou always want to be returning your fingers to correct resting positions. And that is A, S, D, F for the left hand and J, K, L, ; for the right hand.\nLuckily, keyboard manufacturers help a lot with that as both F and J keys have these little bits on them which make it really easy to spot these keys without having to look at them (which, of course, we don’t want to do ).\nBy keeping your fingers in the right position you’ll make sure that your hands can cover the whole keyboard and that you actually type with each of your fingers instead of blasting through the keyboard using nothing else but your index fingers.\n Try to make noise\nEven though this tip might sound weird I found that whenever I type with more force I also tend to type faster.\nTo be honest, I haven’t found any data to prove that scientifically but whenever I have to type quieter, for example when I’m in a library or I don’t want to annoy other people, my typing speed goes down. I’d say that it’s all about the mentality of typing with more force that then translates to faster typing.\nAnd if it works for me it might as well work for you so feel free to experiment with this – a bit odd – tip.\n Treat it as a game\nWorking on your typing speed may feel daunting and you may find that after a few days of practice nothing has changed or even worse, your WPM score went down.\nSo to keep yourself on the right track, try to gamify the process. This way, you’ll see the progress which is always encouraging.\nLet’s say you’re currently typing with a speed of 60 WPM and you want to improve your score by 40 WPM to hit that sweet 100. Of course, it’s going to take some time and the gap between the two might look discouraging at first. What you can do is you can split this route into smaller milestones or levels. Level 1 would be to hit 65 WPM, level 2 70 WPM and so on and so on…\nIt’ll make the whole thing much more fun and achievable.\nPersonally, I’m at the stage where my next level is to improve how I use my left pinky. Currently, all I’m using it for is to click the SHIFT key while I should be using it to hit A, Q, 1, 2, and SHIFT so I’m clearly suboptimal when it comes to that aspect of typing.\nSo, as you can see, the game never ends!\nConclusion\nLearning to type faster was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made and since we’re all using our computers on a daily basis (and most of us use it for work) I believe that it can also become your best decision.\nSure, you don’t have to use all 8 tips. In fact, if you’re just starting out I’d learn the necessary keyboard shortcuts, practice using 10fastfingers, and above all else make the whole improvement process fun. Then as you’ll get better at better crashing through the next milestones try to add other tips like not looking at your keyboard to your current practice stack.\nAnd, by the way, if you’d like to see me using and explaining all of the above tips I have a video on How I Type Really Fast which you’ll find down below.\n\nLastly, if you enjoyed this article, you should check out my Skillshare class where I teach how to Triple Your Typing Speed. It’s free for the first month and once you’re there you can check the rest of my 10 classes on productivity and various skills like video editing or starting your own side hustle. Till the next one."

    "article_body": "A few weeks ago, I got a chance to interview Justin Kan. Justin is a co-founder of Twitch (which sold to Amazon for $1B in 2014). For me, he belongs firmly in the category of ‘Big Deals’ in the entrepreneurial sphere. So before the interview starts, my mind goes into overdrive:\nI want him to like me but also I want to interview him properly and I also don’t want him to just think that I’m using him for the content…\nUnnecessary, right? The worst/best part is that once I actually did the interview, all these thoughts went away and I quickly realised it was just good old overthinking.\nWhile overthinking might sound petty, once it turns into an ongoing habit it can keep us away from ever finishing our work, lead to procrastination, and even cause serious mental health issues.\nSo in this post, I’d love to share the 7 techniques that my creative friends and I use to cope with overthinking. Plus, I’ll share a few findings to give you a big picture of why overthinking is worth discussing as well as tips for learning how to avoid or at least cope with it.\nWhat causes overthinking?\nBasically, there are two types of overthinking:\n\nRuminating – rehashing the past. It happens when we relive the same scenario over and over.\nWorrying – letting our thoughts drift into the future, and worrying about what the future might bring.\n\nRumination is focused on the past and worrying on the future, but they’re both mainly caused by two basic things – stress and anxiety – which then turn on various fightback modes in our brain that lead to overthinking.\n Mode #1 – I need to be prepared\nWhen we’re worrying about future events, (eg: an exam or a job interview), we tend to prep even minutes before the event. When Naval Ravikant (normally a master of zen) was a guest on The Joe Rogan Podcast, he admitted that even though he didn’t want to prepare for this podcast, he couldn’t stop his mind from having an illusory conversation.\nA few days leading up to this [episode], my mind was just running and normally my mind is pretty calm. It was just running, running, and running. And every thought I’d have, I’d imagine me saying it to you. My brain couldn’t help but rehearse.\nThis happens because we want to gain control and make sure we cover (and somehow predict) all possible outcomes. Being prepared is a good thing but at some point, it’s much better to calm our mind instead of feeding it with new information.\n Mode #2 – More work equals better results\nOur thinking works in a similar fashion to our income with diminishing returns. Just like making more money can make us happier only up to a certain level, thinking more can yield better results only to some extent.\nSome people who struggle with overthinking do it because of the ‘more thinking equals better output’ approach. And just like with personal finances, after you move past a certain level, more thinking can actually equal worse outcomes.\n\nWhen people start making more than six figures (on average) their level of happiness goes down. The same mechanism works in thinking. It’s bad not to use our brainpower to prepare for the exam or a job interview, but if we do it for too long we’ll find ourselves with worse results compared to spending fewer hours on preparation.\nMode #3 – If A works for B, it’ll work for C\nSome things in life are universal but the time allocated to thinking isn’t. The one-size-fits-all approach drastically fails when we apply it to thinking but anxiety can make us use it anyway.\nFollowing this approach can drain our energy levels with just a few simple tasks. When we’re preparing for an exam, we need to be focused for a couple of hours using notes, textbooks, and various slides. But if we were to use the same level of thinking to buy groceries for example, we’d get stuck overthinking which type of butter to buy.\nWhy overthinking is bad for us\nWhile everyone ruminates or worries from time to time, constant overthinking comes with serious repercussions.\n Rumination exacerbates depression\nAlthough it’s not common, studies like this one published in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology show that overthinking can lead to serious mental health issues including depression.\n[..] Rumination was a mediator of the longitudinal association between self-reported stressful life events and anxiety symptoms among adolescents and adults and both males and females. In addition, rumination significantly mediated the relationship between self-reported stressful life events and increases in depressive symptoms in adults, but not in adolescents.\nSo, if a stressful event wasn’t enough, our overthinking can take it up a notch turning it into depression and anxiety.\n Overthinking overloads our brains\nOverthinking is also the #1 enemy of every creative person. That’s because we’re more creative when certain parts of our brains are quiet.\nA recent study suggests that the less-is-more approach to thinking works great for creative output. Plus, you’ll save a lot of time that you’d otherwise spend overthinking.\n Overthinking impairs problem-solving\nEqually, our brains are capable of processing lots of data but it’s still possible to overload them and end up in a creative dead zone. This finding becomes more important when we take a look at another study run by scientists from Yale and UCR. Researchers from these two universities were wondering to what extent rumination exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, and impairs problem-solving. Surprisingly, it turned out that rumination is to depression what oxygen is to flame—maintaining and exacerbating its effects.\nSpecifically, rumination appears to more consistently predict the onset of depression rather than the duration, but rumination interacts with negative cognitive styles to predict the duration of depressive symptoms\nThat’s an even more concerning effect for creatives as rumination enhances negative mood-congruent thinking and impairs problem-solving. When we combine these findings with why we overthink it turns out that we’re causing the exact same problem that we’re trying to solve. We think more to have better results while, in fact, we turn on the analysis-paralysis and further worry.\n[…] rumination maintains and exacerbates depression by enhancing negative mood-congruent thinking, impairing problem-solving and instrumental behaviour, and deterring social support.\nHow to stop overthinking?\nIf it’s so bad for us then it’s worth asking: How do we avoid overthinking?\nRemember that the processes involved in overthinking are useful skills. Therefore, to beat overthinking we need to transfer these skills to useful purposes instead. While there are many ways to do it, most techniques and strategies focus on two aspects:\n\ntime allocation\nmind clarity\n\nWith a clean slate and a certain plan for the day, you can avoid overthinking and focus your brainpower on things that matter to you.\nIn the next section, we’ll go through 7 techniques that work best for me and other creative people who once struggled with overthinking.\n7 ways to stop overthinking\n Meditation\nMeditation is a concept that I’ve been dabbling with since early 2019 when I tried to meditate with Sam Harris’s Waking Up app but ultimately failed to build a consistent habit.\nWhenever I talk to creators, online entrepreneurs, or so-called ‘successful people’, they all tend to agree that meditation was the one technique that helped them clear their mind.\nLet’s go back to the Not Overthinking episode with Justin Kan. It turned out that Justin is very bullish on meditation:\nMeditation has made me much more accepting of my present-moment experience. Whatever it is. Whether it’s great and it’s joyful – things that are easy to accept in daily life but also when I’m feeling guilty, angry or when something bad happens. So, for me, meditation is the most important skill I’ve ever learnt because I’m no longer fighting against my experience.\n\nThe same thing popped up in two of the Deep Dives episodes.\nAugust Bradley who’s a business performance coach, strategist, entrepreneur and Notion expert said that:\nPractising meditation enables you to recognise that the thoughts and stories that are generated by your mind are not who you are. By meditating you learn to step out and observe those thoughts and stories rather than believing them.\nSame story with my friend and fellow YouTuber UnJaded Jade:\nMeditation is not just about sitting quietly for a few minutes every day – it’s about training the brain to filter out negative thought processes that hamper us daily.\nMeditation, although simple at its core, is quite hard to get into as it requires us to do nothing. And for overthinkers, that’s a very tough call to make. But it’s also a perfect way for us to clear our mind, settle the internal dispute, and prevent further rumination or worry.\nProbably the easiest way to start practising meditation is to follow Naval’s tip that he shared during the earlier mentioned podcast episode with Joe Rogan. And that is to:\nSit down, close your eyes, comfortable position, whatever happens, happens. If you think, you think. If you don’t think, you don’t think. Don’t put effort into it. Don’t put effort against it. […] You just sit.\n Seek forgiveness rather than permission\nThinking through one idea over and over might happen because we’re scared of committing to our choices. When we’re afraid to push the button, worrying can become our default state.\nIf that happens to you, think about the worst possible consequence of what you want to do. Chances are, the reality is less scary than you initially assumed. Plus, you’ll likely find out that the chances of the worst-case scenario happening are negligible.\nIn one of my recent videos on 21 Tips for My 18-Year-Old Self, I share the advice to\nSeek forgiveness rather than permission\nThis means that rather than sitting on that idea you have and overthinking the consequences you should do it and then (if needed) seek forgiveness.\n\n Prop your door open\nAnother way to stop overthinking is to create intentional distractions from what makes you overthink.\nIn my video on 10 Cheap Purchases that Improved my Life, I chose a doorstop as one of the best bang-for-the-buck purchases I’ve ever made. When I was back in university, I quickly realised that spending a couple of hours more to get a 1% higher grade wasn’t worth it. So, while others were closing their door, I decided to prop mine open and invite anyone who wanted to interrupt me while I was working.\nThis created an intentional distraction and kept me away from worrying too much over the exam or spending too much time revising that one paper. And, as a nice second-order benefit, it led to many fun and entertaining conversations with my new friends.\n\nTherefore, try to find how you can implement intentional distractions that are going to break the overthinking loop that you’d otherwise get into.\n Journal like a Stoic\nSeneca, one of the most well-known Stoic philosophers, used to journal every night to reflect on his day. Such a practice makes it easier to let loose of constraining thoughts and rumination by transferring them onto paper. The way I implement journaling for better mental clarity is by writing Morning Pages.\n\n Live longer and healthier – Not going great. I’m reading Fast this Way by @bulletproofexec, which is giving me an introduction to the world of intermittent and other types of fasting, which are apparently good for longevity.\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) March 3, 2021\n\nAnother way that I dabble with journaling is by using a Notion template that I use every morning and night to properly start and close the day. Inside the template, there are questions such as:\n\nOne thing that I could have done to make today better and how can I apply it tomorrow?\nAm I resisting something?\nFavourite thing of my day?\n\nBy filling out these points I push my mind towards more mindful thinking about the day and by reflecting on all the things I’ve done I leave no room for ruminating over the past.\n\nThis Notion template was created by one of my friends, Valentin Perez who I’ve interviewed in one of the Deep Dives (check it out here). And, if you want to grab the Morning Pages template, you can get it here.\nGoing back to Stoicism, I’ve found that adopting the right mindset is one of the best ways to beat issues like stress or overthinking, at least in my life. When we focus our mind on the things that matter to us and find a way to be happy, the rest will take care of itself. If you’re interested in learning more about this, I have a whole Skillshare Masterclass on Stoicism that you can sign up for below. It’s 100% free and once you’re there, you can check out the rest of my Skillshare courses along with lessons from hundreds of other creators.\n Be more grateful\nOnce again we’re going to steal some ideas from Justin Kan In the same podcast episode, Justin shared how gratitude journaling is one of his keystone habits.\n\nThere are many different ways to approach it but the way that works best for Justin is to just write down 3 things that he’s grateful for. This ridiculously simple practice can, as many people back up, improve your happiness and make you see the highlights of your life.\nSimilarly to meditation, it’s the technique that I’d love to explore in-depth and in fact, I’m committing to gratitude journaling and will continue with the habit for the next couple of weeks (which I shared in my recent March Goals Report).\n\n Do more journaling – Journaling is apparently good for one’s health and wellbeing. I’ve been dabbling in it through Morning Pages, but I want to take it more seriously moving forward. This public journal feels like a good way of going about that.\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) March 3, 2021\n\n Acknowledge your successes\nWe often put too much emphasis on things that went wrong which makes us forget about all of our accomplishments.\nOverthinking can take our self-esteem to an all-time low so it might be worth having an ace in the pack that we can use to counter such feelings. One way to do it is to keep all the nice things about yourself in one place.\nDid someone compliment you? Write it down. A subscriber wrote a nice comment? Copy and paste. A stranger sent you a thank-you email? Forward and save.\nMy favourite method for this is Day One. It’s a journaling app that makes it easy to save and organise things like screenshots, images or emails. All these features make it a perfect solution to create a good-things directory that I can use anytime things seem not to work out.\n\n\nMy Annual Review is my way to reflect on pretty much everything that happened over the course of the past 12 months. It’s got 3main steps, with the first one called Reflect. I break this particular step down into four smaller points:\n\nStuff I’m grateful for\nWhat happened this year?\nCool stuff I discovered this year\nReflective questions\n\nWhile I’m making the Annual Review it feels like the time goes slower. Suddenly I can remind myself of all the awesome things that happened this year. Most importantly, it gives me time to reflect and leaves no room for ruminating or even worrying as the next two steps (Plan and Execute) are all about getting ready for what life has to offer in the next 12 months.\n Spot Cognitive Distortions\nPerspective can change how we interpret any situation. What we might take as a loss, someone else can treat as a victory. By just changing how we look at things, we can reframe negative scenarios as successes.\nThere are lots of cognitive distortions that we fall into every day. One way to tackle this is to care only about what we’re in control of. For example, in the past, I was worried about the future of my YouTube channel as I was focused on reaching certain subscribers goals. When I switched my thinking from outcome-driven -&gt; I want to get to 2 million subs in a year to process-driven -&gt; I will publish three videos a week for three years (and let’s see what happens), things started to change.\nWhy? Let’s break down both approaches.\n1 – I reached 1.8 million subs. It’s a great accomplishment but there’s no joy because it wasn’t enough to achieve the goal I set. Sure, 1.8 million subs is a lot but it’s not what I was aiming for.\n2 – I reached 1.8 million subs publishing three videos a week for 3 years. Same outcome but a much different perspective. In this scenario, I’m everything but sad. I stuck with my goal that I’m in control of and achieved something worth celebrating.\nBe mindful of what you might be interpreting to your disadvantage. Reframe it or dump it completely if it doesn’t make you happy.\n\nSuccess isn’t about getting more done, it’s about having more fun.\nIf you’re having fun, productivity takes care of itself.\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) February 26, 2021\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nOverthinking is a product of using useful resources in the wrong way. Luckily, it’s also a sign that we have these resources so all we have to do is to flick the switch.\nMost importantly, overthinking stands in our way to being productive and happy so it should be our priority to find a way to tame it. And for creative people, like you and me, creating more brainpower and room for thinking will only be a good thing.\nAnd don’t give up if one technique doesn’t work. Some habits won’t stick or it’s not the right time or environment for you to implement them. Experiment with all seven and find the one or two that feel like the missing piece of the puzzle.\nIf you liked this article and the tips I shared, you may also enjoy my weekly newsletter – The Friendzone.

    "article_body": "The secret to success is to pick something, and work on it for 10 years.\nI came across this quote in a Y Combinator interview with Courtland Allen, who made an amazing website/community called Indie Hackers. I think he attributed the quote to ‘some guy on Twitter’, and that’s where the trail ends.\nAs soon as he said that out loud in the interview, I felt my world shatter metaphorically at its implications. The secret to success is to just pick something, and work on it for 10 years. That’s just incredible. It can apply to businesses, hobbies, musical instruments, YouTube channels – pretty much anything can be ‘successful’ if you work at it for long enough.\nI found myself thinking of this quote in the context of my fledgling YouTube career. I started making videos on YouTube properly in July 2017. The YouTubers who I look up to (Kurt Schneider, Alex Goot, a lot of others in the musical scene) started their channels pre-2010, and have been working on them ever since (8+ years). Their secret to their success was to pick an idea, and work on it for an extended period of time, pumping out content and steadily improving their skills.\nI’m tentatively hoping that I can do the same with my channel. Of course, the best time to start a channel was 2010, but the second-best time is now. And now that I’ve started, and enjoy it, as long as I keep at it (and hopefully keep enjoying it), it’ll be hard, in a way, for it not to be ‘successful’.\nI think its also useful to think about what ‘success’ actually means. To me, at this moment, ‘success’ means something like ‘you enjoy what you’re doing, you’re doing a good job, you’re sharing it with others, and maybe you’re making a bit of money from it’.\nI suppose also, there’s very little point in attaining ‘success’ if that doesn’t lead to ‘happiness’. So maybe our definition of success should include ‘and you’re happy doing it’.\nReminds me of a question that Tim Ferriss often asks in his podcasts – When you think of the word successful, who’s the first person who comes to mind?. One of the guests said ‘it depends on what that person’s goal was / whether they’re happy. Everyone thinks of Richard Branson as being successful, but if he’s miserable in his life, is that really success?’\nAnyway, back to the topic of this blog post – the secret to success is to pick something and work on it for 10 years. I love this, and I’m going to remind myself of it whenever I feel like my channel is growing fast enough, or my business isn’t making as much money as it used to, or I feel my guitar/piano skills are underdeveloped, or my medical knowledge is lacking.\nAll it takes is patience – to slowly improve over time and keep at it. Hopefully while having fun along the way."

    "category": "Productivity",

      "https://aliabdaal.com/best-productivity-apps/"
    ],
    "article_body": "I’ve refined my collection of ‘best productivity apps’ over many, many years. I’ve kept all the good apps, and deleted any that weren’t efficient, or easy to work with.\nI used most of these apps in my old life as a medical student and junior doctor, to help me study and create videos on the side. Now, I use them to run multiple businesses and grow a 3M-subscriber YouTube channel.\nOK, let’s get started.\n My Five Categories\nBroadly speaking, I have five categories for my productivity apps, based on what I use them for:\nCoordinate – to coordinate my schedule, to-do’s, and keep track of documents.\nCommunicate – for chatting with friends, and communicating productively with my team.\nConsume – for reading, listening to podcasts, and soaking up knowledge.\nCapture – for note-taking, highlighting, and retaining useful bits of information from the things I consume.\nCreate – where the magic happens, the apps I use to draft + create my own original content.\n Coordinate\nYou need three main things in the Coordinate department. A calendar to manage your schedule, a task management system to track to-do’s, and a file management system for all your documents. The best productivity apps\n 1. Fantastical\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $3.33/month\nFantastical is the calendar app I’ve used for the last five years. It’s absolutely sick. Although it’s Mac only, it can connect to Google, iCloud and Outlook calendars. So all of your events are in one place.\nAnd it looks really pretty.\nOne of the things I like most about Fantastical is its natural language processing. For example, here’s how I create a new calendar event. I just type ‘15th of April 3-5pm, meeting with Taimur at Nandos’. And Fantastical will add that to my calendar with all the relevant information. Which is super handy.\nThe way I run my life, unless something is in my calendar it basically doesn’t exist. I never have to worry or wonder about what I’m doing next. It’s all there on the calendar.\n 2. Google Drive\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: 15GB free, 100GB $1.99/month, 2TB $9.99/month\nAlthough I’m an Apple fanboy, I don’t use iCloud for file management. I’m Google Drive all the way, and have been for the last 10 years. It’s simple, uber-reliable, and does the job.\nI have a personal Google Drive account (2TB storage) for my own photos and documents. And for business stuff, we use Google Workspace, which has unlimited storage – we’ve used 20.3 terabytes of Google Drive storage as a team so far.\nIt’s pretty insane that you get that much storage as part of the business plan.\n 3. Todoist\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, or $5/month for premium\nTodoist is my productivity app of choice for task management. It’s simple, cheap (there’s a free version), and works on any platform (Windows, iPhone, Android, etc). You can organise your to-dos any way you want, with due dates, reminders, and sub-tasks for bigger projects.\nI use the sharing features to delegate tasks to my executive assistant. So I just create a project called ‘Dan’, and put tasks in there that I’d like him to sort out. Todoist is also where I track my bucket list: rollerblading, archery, hunting, glamping, mountain biking, wakeboarding… and so on.\n 4. Notion\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $5/month premium\nNotion is the main app I use for producing YouTube videos, planning my Deep Dive podcast, running the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, and getting stuff done in my business.\nMy favourite thing about Notion is how easy it is to customise workflows. Kanban boards, video embeds, smart spreadsheets, and way more.\nThere are a ton of features. But the key to using Notion is to start off with a very simple system, and build it up over time.\nIt’s a super-clean and minimalist app by default, but I like to give my pages some character, with emojis and images. Notion also has a massive online community creating free &amp; paid templates (check out my free video YouTube creator templates).\n 5. OnePassword\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $2.99/month\nOnePassword keeps all of my passwords in one place, so I can easily login to any website without having to remember a zillion different combinations. It also auto-generates strong passwords when you set up a new account, so you’re not using duplicates that leave all your accounts vulnerable if just one gets hacked.\n Communicate\nUsing effective communication apps makes a huge difference to your life. They free up space for getting stuff done, so you don’t collapse under an avalanche of messages and ‘quick Zoom calls’.\nHere are the best productivity apps I use for communicating.\n 6. Texts.com\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $15/month\nOne of my favourite new productivity apps is called Texts. It links to all your different messaging apps (WhatsApp, iMessage, Twitter DM’s, Telegram, etc), and pulls all those messages into one place, on the Texts web browser.\nI’m bad at replying to messages, and usually have dozens if not hundreds of unread messages across different platforms. But, when I do get time to reply to things, Texts lets me bash through everything on my computer without getting distracted.\nIt also has a bunch of smart features that make it easier to get to inbox zero.\n 7. Superhuman\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $30/month\nI’ve used Superhuman since 2018/19 for all my email. It’s a super-slick app that connects to your Gmail account, and makes emails easier to navigate and filter. You can use lots of shortcuts to make processing your email much more productive.\nBut at $30 a month it’s honestly pretty expensive. Useful if you get large amounts of email and need to blitz through it at rapid speed. But probably excessive for most people, as you can get free email apps that do exactly the same thing.\nBut I do get through my inbox a lot faster than I used to, and that’s worth it for me.\n 8. Loom\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free (up to 5 minutes per recording), $8/month premium.\nLoom is a great productivity app for sending async video messages. Use a webcam or screen record (or both), start chatting, then send the video file to whoever you like.\nLet’s say someone on my team is doing a presentation. Rather than doing it in a Zoom meeting (where everyone has to waste time setting up etc), the presenter will just record a Loom and send it out. Then we can all watch at 2x speed and understand what’s going on quickly and efficiently.\nSometimes at the end of the week I record a weekly update for the team on Loom. It’s so much easier for me to just speak to a camera or speak to my phone rather than write out a word-for-word company update.\nIf you’re a freelancer, Loom is also great for communicating with clients.\n 9. Slack\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, or $6.67/month for premium.\nI use Slack for team communication – it’s great. We have a channel for announcements, team video suggestions, a watercooler for random chat, and so on. There are also channels for courses, email, podcasts, social media, the website, hiring, etc.\nIf you work with a team and are still using group emails or even a WhatsApp group, Slack is the productivity app you want. You won’t regret it.\n 10. Discord\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free\nI’ve recently started using Discord as a community platform for fans of my channel. You can have voice chats, multiple channels for different topics (a bit like Slack), and it’s just a chill place.\nWe also have a Discord for students of my Part-Time YouTuber Academy, where they can discuss YouTube strategy, new ideas, and chat to one other.\n Consume\nThese are the apps I use to productively read and listen to books, podcasts, and articles.\nIf you read a lot of books and articles, or listen to a lot of podcasts or audiobooks, try to experiment with different apps. You might find one that makes the whole experience a lot more enjoyable, not to mention effective.\nGetting inspired by things other people have created is the starting point for most of my creative ideas.\n 11. Kindle\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free (the app, not the device)\nI read almost all of my books on Kindle . And the nice thing about the Kindle app is that it syncs across all platforms (desktop, mobile, physical Kindles, Amazon account). So you can pick up where you left off, and have your books everywhere all at once.\nI have two physical Kindles, one that’s always on my bedside table, and one that’s always in my travel bag, so I’m never without one. And if I’m feeling particularly productive (like if I’m in an Uber or on public transport), I’ll use the Kindle app on my iPhone. And that’s what I do if I need to productively blitz through a book for research purposes.\n 12. Instapaper\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $2.99 premium\nInstapaper is one of the best read-it-later apps around.\nIf I come across an article on the internet, and don’t have time to read it there and then, I’ll chuck it onto Instapaper. Then, when I’ve got a moment (on the toilet, sitting on a bus) I’ll open up Instapaper and have a read through the articles I’ve saved.\nAgain, Instapaper is cross-platform, so you can access your account and start reading from loads of different devices. Instapaper also has a really good highlight feature, which comes in handy when it links to Readwise (more on that later).\n 13. Audible\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $7.95/month\nI use Audible for all my audiobook listening. It’s just an amazing app, particularly for skimming through nonfiction books at x2 speed. I also listen to a fair bit of fantasy fiction: Brandon Sanderson’ books are a personal favourite.\nIf you get an Audible subscription, you get one credit per month to buy whatever book you like. It’s a good way of testing out the first few chapters of a book before buying it on Kindle.\n 14. Castro\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $2.99/month\nI’ve experimented with so many different podcast apps over the years. Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Overcast… but the best app I’ve landed on is Castro. It lets you do a bunch of small but useful things like:\n\nSet a custom start position for podcasts with repetitive intros.\nSpeed up the podcast\nControl playback from Apple Watch\n\nAnd there’s good functionality for discovering new podcasts as well (like my own podcast, Deep Dive ). So you can do more productive podcast listening while travelling or going for walks.\n 15. Shortform\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $16.42/month, billed annually (or 20% less using my link)\nShortform has the best library of book summaries I’ve ever come across. I mainly use their iOS app on my phone, but they also have a web app that I use on Mac.\nTheir summaries are very in-depth: you get a one page summary, to see if this is the type of book you want to read. And then you get detailed chapter summaries. Even cooler, Shortform also bring in insights from other books as little ‘snippets’. I get so much value out of reading Shortform summaries, and the app is simple and intuitive.\nIt’s a really productive use of your time, especially if you regularly don’t finish books because you have no time.\n Capture\nNow, ‘Capture’ is important if you want to remember and refer back to the books, podcasts, articles etc that you’ve consumed. This is really important if you’re a content creator or writer. If you can build your own note-taking system, you have a personalised library of thoughts and cool sources to draw on.\n 16. Readwise\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $7.99/month\nReadwise essentially captures and stores all of your highlights from Kindle, Apple Books, Instapaper, podcast apps, and so on. Any time you highlight something, it will syncs to your Readwise database.\nOne basic feature of Readwise is that it sends you an email every day with five of your highlights, chosen at random. Which is a fun way of revisiting old books.\nBut Readwise’s most powerful feature is that it can automatically export all of your highlights to note-taking apps like Notion or Roam. So if you’re a content creator like me and you’re trying to build an automated note-taking system, you can just chuck highlights from everywhere into Readwise and know they’ll arrive in your notes app of choice.\nDefinitely a contender for best productivity app, especially if you’re a creator like me.\n 17. Apple Notes\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free\nApple Notes is my go-to app for quick, simple notes. I use it to capture fleeting ideas (including for YouTube scripts), the occasional shopping list, and things like that. I’ve even been using Apple notes for my book research.\nIt just works, and syncs across all my Apple devices.\nI often use it for capturing information from podcasts, because I still haven’t found a good podcast clipper that can send text to Readwise. And even though it seems simple, there are a lot of deceptively powerful features, like AI text recognition for photos you import.\nIf I had to choose just one app for productive writing… it might be Apple Notes.\n 18. Day One\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $2.92/month premium\nDay One is a beautifully designed journalling app. I wrote a whole newsletter issue about this. I use it on my Mac, iPad and iPhone in three main ways:\n\n Brain dumps and normal journal entries.\n Keeping a folder of nice YouTube / online comments that I can look at when I’m feeling down. (I email screenshots directly to this journal, which is super convenient).\n⏳ Keeping photos of birthday cards and other messages, so I can look back at them without cluttering my flat with bits of paper.\n\nBut it’s also good for saving random memories (like my grandma asking if I can buy her some Bitcoin).\n 19. Strong\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $4.99 premium\nStrong is the app that I use to track my workouts at the gym (it’s in the capture section because it’s essentially capturing data). Strong lets you design custom workouts, and then tells you a) what weight you lifted last time, and b) how many reps you did.\nSo if you’re like me and you make shit up when you go to the gym, at least you’ll know what you lifted last time. And you can try to lift a little bit heavier than that. It’s good to incorporate progressive overload and all that good stuff if you want to get #hench. Productive gym sessions, here we come.\n Create\nThis is what it’s all been leading up to. Are you really being productive unless you’re creating something? These are the best productivity apps I use for creating my YouTube videos.\n 20. Photoshop\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $9.99/month for the Adobe Photography Plan (Photoshop, Lightroom, 20GB of cloud storage).\nI use Photoshop whenever I need to do anything fancy with image manipulation. For example, it’s great for creating polished YouTube thumbnails. You can just drag and drop images from your desktop into the Photoshop app, and get to work.\nI’m not a power user, but Adobe do a really good job with all their Creative Cloud apps like Lightroom, Photoshop, and Premiere Pro. So if you do a lot of work with images, it’s worth the hefty monthly subscription to get them all as a package. No list of the best productivity apps for creators is complete without Photoshop.\n 21. Figma\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $12/month premium\nFigma is an absolutely amazing web application for visual design. It’s how I do mock ups for logos, web designs, Instagram carousels, and other things on the design side. I even used Figma to design this website.\nIt’s also great for quick brainstorms, eg for my company’s organisational chart. Nowadays though, my main use-case is making and reviewing YouTube thumbnail concepts.\n 22. Recut\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $99 one-off payment (with 1 year of updates).\nRecut is really handy if you’re a podcaster or YouTuber. It removes silence from your videos and audio automatically, which saves a ton of time in the editing booth. That also makes for a more compelling video/podcast, because the listener doesn’t have to sit through all the ‘ummms….’ and random pauses.\nIf you’re editing long conversations regularly, do yourself a favour and get Recut. It can easily 2x your editing productivity.\n⌨ 23. Descript\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: Free, $12, or $24 for premium\nDescript is another cool little app for editing. Basically, it lets you edit video like a Word documents. So for example, when editing a podcast, we’ll import it into Descript, which generates a transcript, and we’ll be able to just edit that transcript like it’s a Word document, cutting out the corresponding bits of video.\n 24. Final Cut Pro X\n\nUsefulness Score: \nPrice: $299.99, one-off payment\nFinal Cut Pro X is my absolute favourite video editing software. The basic features are very intuitive, so you can start editing within an hour or so. But it also has a LOT of powerful features, including smart object detection (it identifies objects in your footage, and can show you all the instances where they appear), and\nIf you like, you can check out my Final Cut Pro X course over on Skillshare to learn all the basics and a few cool tricks I use for my YouTube editing.\nI hope you enjoyed this list of – what I think are – the best productivity apps!\nFor a breakdown of my personal productivity system, check out this video:"

    ],
    "article_body": "I recently turned 28 years old \nSo I thought I’d do a roundup of the best life advice I’ve gathered during my 28 years on this planet. \n1. Set Intentional Defaults\nMost of the time, we just do the same stuff we’ve always done. All day, every day.\nIn other words, your defaults govern your behaviour.\nSo, setting new defaults can be pretty powerful. I also find that ‘switching my defaults’ feels less like hard work than ‘building new habits’.\nHere are some examples of setting intentional defaults:\n\nDeciding to keep your phone in another room during family meals, to be more in the moment.\nStopping work at 6pm.\n\nOne intentional default I’ve been setting myself is to walk from my flat to the studio every day. I’m basically training myself to see this as the ‘new normal’ in my life.\n 2. Lower the Bar\nOn to my next piece of life advice: lower the bar.\nThis is my best strategy for dealing with procrastination. Usually, if I’m procrastinating it’s because I’m setting my standards too high, being a perfectionist.\nHere’s something Seth Godin says in his mini-article ‘Write something’:\nThere’s no such thing as writer’s block. There’s simply a fear of bad writing. Do enough bad writing and some good writing is bound to show up.– Seth Godin\nIf you think you have writer’s block and you can’t write anything good, show me all the bad writing you did. Chances are, you haven’t done any bad writing because your standards are so high. And that’s why you haven’t created anything yet.\nWhen you find yourself unable to start, that’s your cue to lower the bar. Just try to embrace the thought that ‘this thing is going to suck’. And that’s okay. Because once you get started, it’s way easier to continue going. And you’ll usually find that whatever you created wasn’t actually that bad.\n 3. Embrace Mediocrity\nI also think we should straight-up embrace mediocrity in lots of areas of our life.\nThis idea comes from Oliver Burkeman’s fantastic book Four Thousand Weeks. In the world of productivity we tend to think we could do everything we want – if only we had the right tools and systems.\nBut in reality, there aren’t enough hours in the day to do everything. We have to embrace mediocrity in some parts of our life, so we can actually focus on the handful of things that really matter to us.\nI’ve embraced mediocrity in a couple of ways at work. I don’t take this website as seriously as I could, for example. Or TikTok. And I’m not very active on LinkedIn. Instead, I focus on writing my book, making videos, and teaching people how to be YouTubers.\nIt’s all about setting priorities, and accepting that you can’t do everything perfectly.\n 4. Work with Background Music\nThis makes studying, working, and household chores way more fun. And life in general starts feeling higher energy.\nWhen I was living in Cambridge I had my Alexa smart speaker set up, and I’d roam the house blasting Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran. Something about having music on in the background just really, really energises me.\nAnd when I turn on music at work, it’s like an injection of energy into the room that makes me feel way more creative. So I massively recommend blasting the tunes when you get a chance.\n 5. Quantity and Consistency = Quality\nThis next piece of life advice won’t be new to anyone who’s into personal development, or read books like Atomic Habits.\nBut it’s worth saying again: quantity and consistency generally lead to quality:\n If you want to get good at painting, do 100 paintings.\n If you want to get good at making YouTube videos, make 100 videos.\nThe things you create might well suck, but you’ll get better at making them. Put in the reps.\nI made this mistake when I was dabbling with songwriting. I’d be very precious about a single song, and try to perfect it. And to this day, I’ve written maybe 0.5 songs, because I never embraced this attitude of quantity leading to quality.\nTo get good at something, just show up consistently, and don’t worry too much about the outcome.\n 6. Quantity and Consistency = Creativity\nQuantity and consistency also lead to creativity. For the last 25 years or so, Seth Godin has published a short article every single day on his blog. That’s just wild.\nI think the more you consistently do creative things, the more creativity starts flows from inside you, and you get more inspired. Ed Sheeran says this about songwriting, and Neil Gaiman about writing: creativity is a bit like an old tap. You have to turn it on and let all of the crap flow out first (sometimes for a long time) before you get a flow of clean water. You have to get all the junk out of your system.\n 7. Send Thank You Notes\nMy seventh piece of life advice is quite simple, but massively underrated.\nBasically, send thank you notes, especially physical ones. It’ll feel really good, not only for you, but also for the person you’ve just thanked. So I have a long stack of thank you cards with stamps and envelopes, and I try to post those off whenever the mood strikes. I haven’t yet found a postbox that’s close enough to my house that it’s super low friction… But there’s something about sending a handwritten note that feels amazing.\n 8. Planning ≠ Doing\nPlanning and doing are very different things. And it’s important to realise this. The metaphor I like to use (that my brother Taimur came up with) is ‘the pilot and the plane’.\nAt some moments of the day, we should be the pilot. We’re just planning what to do with our day. But then for the rest of the day, we should be the plane. Just executing on the orders of the pilot, without think too hard about why we’re doing this stuff.\nThink about going to the gym and not having a plan. You’d just do a few random exercises, then sit on your phone and scroll, because it’s too much effort to plan and do at the same time. But, if you come up with a plan before going to the gym, you can just be the plane once you arrive, and execute on the pilot’s orders.\n 9. Choose to be Satisfied\nLike a lot of other high-achieving productivity bros, I tend to finish the day feeling like I haven’t done enough. Wondering if I could have been more efficient, more productive, and spent less time scrolling through social media.\nBut this weird pattern of dissatisfaction just makes me feel bad and leads to negative spirals. It also ignores the reality that I usually get something done on any given day.\nSo, what I’ve realised is that I can make the choice to feel satisfied with the progress I’ve made. The situation won’t change, but I’ll have different, better feelings about it.\n 10. Move Towards What Energises You\nWhether it’s work, hobbies, or relationships, we should gravitate towards the things that energise, instead of us drain us. This is a useful mental model for almost every situation.\nLet’s say I’ve been invited to a party and I’m thinking ‘meh, I don’t really feel like it’. The question I ask myself is ‘will going to this party energise me, or will it drain my energy?’ Sometimes, even if I don’t really feel like going, I’ll drag myself out of the house because I know it’ll be energising. And I’ll usually have a great time. But if I know the party will drain me, it’s easy to opt out.\nIt’s just one question, but pretty powerful: ‘will this energise me, or drain me?’\n 11. Fantasy Fiction Books are Amazing\nMy next piece of life advice is to try reading more fantasy fiction.\nFantasy fiction books are absolutely amazing. Everyone who I’ve recommended the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson to has absolutely loved it and become a Brandon Sanderson fanboy for life. In fact I had a chat with the man himself on my Deep Dive podcast.\n\nIf you’re looking to get into audiobooks, Stardust by Neil Gaiman is a good call – he narrates the audiobook himself as well, and he’s an amazing narrator. So, if you’re looking to get into fantasy fiction, I 100% recommend those. I actually have a video where I discuss my favourite fantasy books.\n 12. Don’t Wipe Your Face with a Bath Towel\nVery solid life advice: always wipe your face with a different towel to the one you use in the shower. The one you use in the shower goes into weird places, and you don’t want that on your face. It’ll cause you to break out in spots and stuff.\nI’ve actually found that my skin’s a lot clearer since I started using dedicated face towels. And if I’m out and about without access to face towel, I’ll sort of pat my face dry with my hand once I’m out of the shower.\n13. Have a Skincare Routine\nI’ve been chatting a lot to my friend Usama, who’s a dermatologist based in New York.\n\n As a dermatologist, I think 95% of the truly scientific skincare tips that you should know can fit into one Tweet thread. All Instagram/YouTube/TikTok skincare education videos just repackage a few core principles with different dances/ brand names. Let me prove it…  1/\n— Usama (@usamasyedMD) January 22, 2022\n\nAnd he said that basically, the earlier you start caring about your skin the better it’ll look over time. So now I have a proper skincare routine.\nIn a nutshell:\n Wear sunscreen every day of the year, ideally SPF 50.\n Always moisturise, especially after showering.\n Look into retinoids, they’ll help your skin stay plump and young-looking.\n Use a good cleanser, but that’s a bit more optional.\nPeople have even started commenting on how nice my skin looks since I started doing this about 6 months ago. Here’s a whole video I made on my skincare routine:\n\n⏰ 14. Wake Up at the Same Time Every Day\nMy next piece of life advice is to try to wake up at the same time every day.\nThere’s a lot of compelling evidence that says that long lie-ins and irregular sleeping will mess up your sleep rhythms. So it’s best to power through and get up at your usual time, even if you didn’t get enough sleep the previous night.\nIf you stick to a regular waking time, you’ll fall into a good rhythm and naturally feel like going to sleep/getting up at the same time every day. That’s because your circadian and adenosine rhythms are syncing up – check out this Huberman Lab podcast episode on sleep for more detailed information.\nOn days where I stay up late and have a lie-in the next morning, I have less energy during the day than if I’d just woken up as normal, but with 5-6 hours of sleep.\n15. Keep a Kindle (Not a Phone) on Your Bedside Table\nI’ve been doing this for a while now. And since I’ve mentioned it in my videos, a lot of people have got back to me to say that it’s changed their life as well.\nBasically – don’t keep your phone by your bedside table. Keep it across the room from you, and instead have a Kindle on your nightstand. There’s no option for scrolling through Twitter or Instagram. All you can do is:\n\nRead on the Kindle on warm light mode\nGo to sleep\n\n 16. Don’t Press the ‘Try Harder Button’\nIf I’m struggling to get something done, I usually find myself wanting to press the try harder button.\nThe try harder button is basically where you tell yourself I’m going to try harder, I’m just going to be more disciplined, I’ll have more grit and determination. But it almost never works, because it’s broadly unsustainable.\nIt’s easy to convince ourselves that we’re Superman, and that tomorrow we’ll have this incredible amount of willpower and discipline. But that’s never going to happen.\nIt’s usually better to figure out how we can tweak our systems or environment so we don’t need to try. Atomic Habits by James Clear is the bible on how to do this.\n 17. Monetising Your Passions Is Fun\nPeople often say that you should never monetise your passion – don’t open a bakery just because you like making pies.\nBut actually, monetising your passion can be really fun, especially on a small scale. For example, I used to be a close-up magician. I spent the first two years of my magic obsession just practising in front of a webcam or a mirror. But it was only when I tried to monetise it, and went outside of my comfort zone to book my first restaurant gig (an absolute disaster) and perform at parties that I took my magic (and social) skills to the next level.\nMonetising my hobby made it more fun by raising the stakes.\n 18. …Except When It’s Not\nBut monetising your passions can sometimes take away the fun. I’ve spoken to a bunch of YouTubers who really enjoyed videos when they were part-time. But then when they switched to doing YouTube full-time, suddenly it became a job. And when money becomes a motive, it can crowd out your other more noble or interesting intentions (like ‘living a creative life’ etc).\nThe solution here is to diversify. Try not to make your passion your only source of income, and find other outlets for your creative interests (ok, hobbies I guess) that are less high-stakes.\n 19. Aim to Retire Early\nThis life advice is something I’ve been thinking about a lot recently. Something Naval Ravikant says is:\nRetirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired. You retire by saving up enough money, becoming a monk, or by finding work that feels like play to you.\nSo if we agree with Naval’s definition, retirement sounds pretty good. And there are three ways of getting there:\n\nMake so much money that you can just be retired because you don’t have to work anymore.\nSpend so little money, that you can retire to live a monk-like existence.\nDo work that you love so much, you’d do it for free.\n\nWhat I’m trying to do is some kind of combination of all three. Make a lot of money, lower my expenses, and do work that I find fun.\n 20. Enjoy Each Day on its Own Merits\nI think it’s really important to enjoy each day on its own merits, rather than seeing it as a stepping stone to something greater. Like, ‘if I spend all day grinding at X task, then I’ll be able to do Y’ (what Naval talks about above, ‘sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow’.\nI saw this a lot in medical school. Studying medicine can be really hard, dry, and boring. But people think that when they become a doctor, then life will be fun. When they actually do become a doctor though, life is generally a lot less fun than in medical school.\nSo I think it’s important to change your mindset, to try to enjoy each day and the present moment on its own merits. It’s good to work towards your goals. But in some ways, it’s an even better feeling to say ‘I know this day was good’.\n 21. Take the Social Initiative\nThis piece of life advice will give you superpowers – always take the initiative in social situations.\nI’ve always been the one to organise events, invite friends over for a board games night, or make the first move in a romantic situation. There’s always an element of vulnerability here, because you have to open yourself up to rejection. But people love to be asked to hang out, and whenever I’ve taken the initiative, I’ve always felt oh, wow, this is amazing.\nThis thing would not have happened if I hadn’t organised it, and taken the social initiative.\n 22. Invest in Your Relationships\nIn How Will You Measure Your Life, Clay Christensen notes that most successful people chronically under-invest in their personal relationships.\nHe talks about how his year of MBA graduates were all super-smart and built high-flying careers. They were successful by any traditional metric. But at their 30-year reunion, Clay said that loads of them seemed depressed, and several were separated from their families. Some were even in prison.\nSo Clay asks, why did so many of these smart bright people go down unhappy paths? He concludes that most of this comes from a failure to invest in relationships. We should build better bonds with the people we love.\n 23. Default to Non-Work\nOne thing Clay says – that I’m trying to remind myself of more often – is that it’s wise to default to non-work activities when you have a spare hour.\nWork leads to immediate, tangible benefits. But while putting that same effort into relationships doesn’t have that immediate payoff, it’s a long-term investment that gives compounding interest.\nSo recently, whenever I’ve had a spare hour in the evening I’ve tried to spend that time talking with friends, messaging, and going for walks. Not ploughing more energy into my work life.\n 24. Exercise in the Morning\nI tend to feel way more energised when I’ve done some kind of exercise in the morning.\nIt’s a massive no-brainer, especially if you exercise outdoors, because:\n\nIt wakes you up, gets the blood flowing.\nYou have more energy for the rest of the day.\nYou feel less incentive to do unhealthy stuff for the rest of the day.\nYou don’t need to workout in the evening when you’re tired.\n\n 25. The Sting of Rejection is Better than the Pain of Regret\nThe sting of rejection is almost always way better than the pain of regret. So shoot your shot. It can be a bit meh dealing with rejection, but it’s a lot better than always wondering ‘what if’. This is some of the best life advice I’ve ever come across.\nMy friend Evie even keeps a spreadsheet of all the rejections she gets in life, treating it like a game to get as many as possible.\nBecause if you’re not getting rejected fairly consistently, you’re not really pushing yourself to succeed.\n 26. Even Your Favourite Books Get One-Star Ratings\nI heard someone say once that when they’re procrastinating they look through Amazon and Goodreads for one-star reviews of their favourite books.\nThere’s something very therapeutic about that. It helps you see that everyone’s taste is different, and even the books you think are frickin’ amazing have their haters and one-star reviews.\nAs it gets closer to the release date of my book, I think this is something I’ll have to inoculate myself against. All I can do is just show up, be authentic, and write something that I find interesting.\n 27. Work on Trains\nI travel on trains whenever I can, mainly because they’re a great place to get work done. In fact, trains are a bit like time travel. It’s like being at your desk at home, but you’re also travelling effortlessly towards your destination.\nAnd when I arrive, I’m just like damn, I’m in Edinburgh now. And I’ve just made good progress on my work for the last four hours. How’d that happen?\n 28. Journey Before Destination\nMy final piece of life advice is to always focus on journey before destination. That’s a quote from Brandon Sanderson’s Stormlight Archive series.\nYou have to have a destination of some kind: there’s no journey without a destination. But once you’ve set a destination, it’s usually best to forget about it, and focus on the journey. Enjoy the present moment. I talked about this in a recent Deep Dive podcast with Sahil Bloom:\n\nthere’s a reason I love the phrase ‘journey before destination’ so much.\nI spoke to @SahilBloom about his switch from pro baseball player to a career as a creator, investor and entrepreneur on this episode of Deep Dive  https://t.co/ztVYjcA7ro pic.twitter.com/YqoHYUeG6s\n— Ali Abdaal (@AliAbdaal) August 4, 2022\n\nIf you liked this article, here’s a whole ‘best life advice’ video I made.

    "article_body": "Really excited to say that the Part-Time YouTuber Academy (PTYA) is back and we’ll be launching Cohort 7 of our flagship course on Monday 31st October 2022 at 1600 GMT.\nHere’s a breakdown of everything that’s changed between this Cohort and the last, with some of the thoughts behind the changes we’ve decided to make this time round.\nSo as always, PTYA is a live, cohort-based course where we’ll welcome hundreds of creators who want to level up their YouTube game.\nEach student becomes part of our community of over 2,000 creators and goes through the course with hundreds of other YouTubers, ranging from beginners who want to tackle YouTube with as much knowledge as possible, to advanced creators with millions of subscribers who are trying to find ways to level up their content creation processes and systems.\nChanging the format\nWe’ve decided to tweak the format of the course again this Cohort.\nCohort 6 which took place in summer ‘22 was a five-week live cohort, with instruction and video submission and feedback happening simultaneously.\nHowever, our focus groups and student feedback have indicated that students feel one of the most valuable aspects of the course is being able to submit your video for feedback from a trained team who’ll break down improvements that could be made to a huge range of aspects; from their hook to their production quality, editing, branding choices, flow, end card, you name it.\n Consistency over everything else\nThis lines up with what I’ve always believed to be the most fundamentally important part of becoming a YouTuber – posting YouTube videos.\nIf you’re not willing to consistently post a video a week (or something similar) for at least two years, it’s very hard to say with any certainty what will happen to your YouTube trajectory.\nThe more we can get our students to post videos and improve in small iterations over time, and the more support we can give them to overcome any barriers they’re facing, the more likely it is that they’ll come away from PTYA confident in their ability to consistently post videos every week from then on.\nTo that end, we’ve shorted the instructional part of the course to four weeks of live sessions and workshops.\nAll of the material from the week we’re removing will still be available to anyone who joins Cohort 7, as there’s some really good stuff in there we’ve been working on for a very long time, but an additional two weeks are now being added for people to submit videos for feedback.\n Build you own adventure\nThis means that Cohort 7 will be a little bit more build-your-own-adventure than previous Cohorts – if a student wants to focus on the material at the start and then drop the hammer on the video creation, they’ll have time to do so without the two overlapping.\nIf someone misses a week or two because life gets in the way, they’ll have a chance to catch up and get some really actionable feedback.\nAnd if someone is able to keep their systems in place from the start and consistently produce videos, they’ll have the opportunity to submit a video every week for the six weeks, iterate on the feedback and come away a consistent beast of a creator.\nEach week of the course still focuses on a different topic;  identifying your niche, generating endless content ideas, helping people fall in love with your channel, getting people to click, keeping viewers watching and systematising and scaling your process.\nI’ll be delivering these keynote sessions with a Q&amp;A at the end where people can ask questions on the material or anything else they could use some guidance with, and the full PTYA team will be present to reach out to people who need more support and to help with queries in the chat.\nWe’ll also be hosting dedicated Q&amp;A sessions each week with a happy hour-style session afterwards to do some friendship stuff.\nThe rest of the week is comprised of various workshops covering more specific topics like thumbnails, tech and editing, camera confidence and advanced YouTube theory with a number of incredible experts and members of the team.\nWe’ll also have a weekly guest workshop from content creators like Nathaniel Drew, Lana Blakely and Unjaded Jade and FilmBooth.\n Reducing overwhelm\nIn the past, we’ve had up to three workshops every single day while a Cohort is underway.\nOur goal was always to completely overdeliver on value, but the struggle was always balancing this with entirely overwhelming our students.\nTrimming down the number of workshops ensures that this genuinely is a part-time academy which someone can attend while working or studying full time, and that there are clear and crystallised goals and systems they can work towards and implement.\nIn another effort to reduce overwhelm, we’ve compiled a massive bank of supplementary material for students to work through long after the course has ended. The aim here is to ensure that PTYA isn’t just a one-time valuable experience, but instead gives students actionable tips and interesting and inspiring content they can peruse for weeks (or months) after the Cohort is over.\nWe’ve got over 20 hours more content and more than 10 worksheets in our supplementary materials alone, so it’s basically another course stacked on top of PTYA \nWe’ve got a full breakdown of everything else we’re adding to the course and what you could expect as a student which you can check out on our sick new landing page.\nIf any of the above sounds interesting to you and has you itching to spend the next 4 weeks learning about the ins and outs of YouTube, you can sign up for our waiting list and I’ll let you know once we open PTYA for enrolment on Monday 31st October 2022 (and send you some educational resources so you can already  improve your journey on YouTube).\nThanks!\nAli xx"

    ],
    "article_body": "The unfamiliar is scary territory to be in. Whether we’re trying to ride a bike or want to start a blog, doing something new can be uncomfortable. This article explores the fear of getting started.\nThat initial hesitation is natural. It could be the slightest tinge of self-doubt or even crippling fear. But it’s all totally natural. It’s part and parcel of being human. Luckily, it’s also totally conquerable.\nI believe there are two types of anxieties that feed into the fear of starting new things:\n\nSocial anxiety – fears about how our actions might impact us socially\nSelf-perception – fears about our limitations and weaknesses\n\nIn this article, I’ll talk about these two types of anxieties and the perception shifts that helped me overcome them.\nSocial anxiety – an evolutionary instinct\nOver the years, there’ve been many things that I’ve not done because I fear social disapproval. For example, the fear of rejection has often held me back from asking girls out. Social anxiety is the fear that actions perceived negatively by others will affect my social standing in some way.\nNo advice will completely dissolve your social anxiety. But I can tell you how I’ve worked through mine. For me, understanding where my social anxiety is coming from helped me overcome it.\nOur fear comes from the possibility of social disapproval. We’re vigilant against any potential hits to our social status and standing in the ‘tribe’.\nIf we think in terms of evolutionary psychobiology, fear serves to ensure our survival. There’s the sort of fear you’d feel when a lion is chasing you and your life is in active danger. But we’re also highly attuned to the judgment of other people in our tribe.\nAs prehistoric men, we lived in hunter-gatherer tribes. If you were ostracised from your tribe, it’d potentially be the end of you. You’d have no one to rely on and would have to go out into the wilderness on your own.\nIt’d be very likely that you’d get eaten by that lion chasing you around. You might even just die of starvation. Being part of a tribe was essential for our survival.\nSo our amygdala – the part of the brain that experiences and processes fear – became very attuned to social threats. The risk of ostracization is processed as a danger to our lives. That’s why we evolved to fear other people’s judgement and rejection.\nI’ve been able to shift my perception by recognizing two things:\n\nSocial anxiety is normal\nNo one really cares what I get up to\n\n1) Your social anxiety is totally normal\nWe evolved to be afraid of social approval. Understanding that was really important for me. It enabled me to question my social anxiety.\nWhen I notice this anxiety acting up, I can stop and ask myself: Is this evolutionarily designed fear still useful in my modern-day life? Is there any utility in continuing to live this way?\nObviously, it’s still useful for me to run away when I see a lion. That’s a no-brainer.\nBut is it still useful for me to worry about what my friends will think? Will that actually affect my survival? Will it really kill me if I ask a girl out and she says no? Probably not. Back in my caveman days some 300,000 years ago, yes it might’ve killed me. My tribe could’ve ostracised me because of it.\nBut nowadays, what’s the worst that can happen? Probably not very much. People might laugh at me. I’ll feel the pain internally. But it’s not actually gonna jeopardise my survival. Just being aware of that helps me overcome my fear.\nMy brother was a true visionary in this regard. He started a YouTube channel nearly a decade ago. He’d just make random videos and shove them online. You can still find them, to this day. He just didn’t seem to care what other people thought of him.\n2. No one really cares what you get up to\nMost of us over-index on how much other people care about what we do.\nImagine this thought experiment: your best friend decides to start a podcast and they’re trying to interview people for it. Would you actually judge them for that? Probably not. You probably wouldn’t even care. At most you’d say something encouraging and promise to check it out.\nMaybe internally, for like a millisecond, you’d make fun of them about it. If you do, you’re not a very nice person anyway. But chances are you won’t even be thinking in those ways.\nEmbrace the NOC mindset\nEveryone is worried about other people’s judgment. But if we think about whether we’d actually judge another person, most of us probably wouldn’t. Not for too long anyway.\nIt’s like Eleanor Roosevelt said, You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realised how seldom they do.\nPeople are not thinking about us. You and me, we’re all going about our own lives. I’m not thinking of you and you’re not thinking of me. You’ve got your own problems to deal with.\nYou’re not spending any amount of brainpower thinking about what I’m doing or what people around you are doing. All you’re doing is getting on with your own life.\nThat’s been the second fundamental perception shift for me: recognizing that No One Cares.\nI call this the NOC mindset. Even now I struggle to start things because I fear social disapproval, judgement, and rejection. I’ve to remind myself that no one cares. I can do the thing and no one would really care. No one would be thinking about me at all.\nThis was one of the liberating things about starting a YouTube channel. I thought loads of people would care. No one cared. People at my university were just whatever about it. Sure, a few people laughed at me. But when the channel became successful, those same people were asking to be in the videos.\nBroadly speaking, no one really cared. They weren’t thinking about me. They were living their lives. There’s no need to worry so much about people’s judgement and rejection.\nSelf-perception – the folly of unrealistic standards\nQuite often, we don’t want to try new things because we’re scared we won’t be any good at them. That’s our self-doubt and fear of failure.\nFor me, the easiest strategy to overcome this has been to simply lower the bar and embrace the crap.\nWe fear not being good at new things because our bar is way too high. I see this all the time in my YouTuber Academy.\nWe’ve had about 2000 students go through the YouTuber Academy. Most of them were complete beginners. Our course is what pushed them to start their channels.\nA big part of what holds people back from starting their channels is some combination of perfectionism, self-doubt, and a fear of failure. That’s because their bar is so high.\nLet’s say you’re thinking of starting a YouTube channel. You check out some experienced creators. The videos on their channels look slick and high quality. A lot of effort has probably gone into making their videos look good. A fair bit of equipment too.\nYou feel like you can’t compete with that. To you, those videos represent a standard you can’t even imagine achieving. So you don’t bother starting at all.\nThat’d be like someone comparing themself to a Formula One racer when they start learning to drive. They’d tell themselves there’s in point in learning at all because they can’t possibly drive like Lewis Hamilton. That’s completely dumb, right?\nJust lower the bar and show up\nLower the bar. Recognize that you’re going to suck at things when you first start. It’s ok to suck at something when you first start. Accepting that is a growth mindset.\nWhenever I procrastinate, it’s usually because I’ve set a bar for myself that’s too high. The solution is to lower the bar. Once I’m good at doing the thing consistently, I can then raise my bar.\nRight now I suck at going to the gym. I don’t go regularly enough. For me, it’s a win if I just show up and do one exercise. That’s all I have to do. I’ve lowered the bar. Sometimes I’ll do a token gym session. I just rock up, do one exercise to failure and then I’m done. I’m out of there.\nIf I was competing to be a professional bodybuilder or athlete, this wouldn’t be enough. Then I’d have to keep on raising the bar. But if you’re struggling with getting started, just keep on lowering the bar.\nBy the way, our new cohort of the YouTuber Academy is launching in a few weeks. Head over to our website if you want to check it out.\nConsistent action is the foundation\nNow the question is: how do you improve at the thing when you keep lowering the bar? If you’re struggling with getting started, you need to just embrace the crap. Your aim is just to get going. \nSo for example, when it comes to starting a YouTube channel: one video per week is the threshold. Aim to reach a point where you’re making a video every single week, without fail. Then you can begin to raise the bar and try to get good at it. It’s essential to know what stage of your journey you’re at with that particular thing.\nFor me, the gym is currently a place where I need to lower the bar. But with YouTube, I can afford to raise the bar. I already know how to make videos consistently. It’s not that hard for me. So the way I improve at the craft is by trying to make better videos.\nJust recognize where you’re at on the journey and take consistent action. \nI allow myself to overthink as much as I want as long as I’m taking consistent action. Overthinking becomes a problem only when it stops me from taking action. I overthink the hell out of my YouTube channel. As long as I’m consistently publishing videos, that’s fine. If I stop publishing videos, then overthinking has become a problem.\nOverthinking must happen on a foundation of consistency. If consistency is present, you’re still moving forward. You’re still building a life that you love.\nIf overthinking becomes the foundation and action becomes an addendum, you’re in problematic territory. You’re never going to get anywhere in life. Thinking this way has helped me take consistent action while overcoming my fears."

Enjoy the Journey The Part-Time YouTuber Academy\n\nIntroduction\n My YouTube Story\nStarting a YouTube channel is hands down the best decision I’ve ever made in my life. It all started for me in 2017. When I was in my final year of medical school at Cambridge University and training to be a doctor. Inspired by my favorite YouTuber Peter McKinnon, I decided to pick up a camera and document my journey.\nLike everyone else, I started from the ground up: with 0 subscribers and 0 views. And my videos were a little bit cringe:\n\nI started off by teaching medical school applicants how to do well in entrance exams and interviews. But pretty soon I started vlogging, making more general content about study techniques, tech, and productivity. And over time, I slowly improved. A few of my videos went viral. The channel started to grow, and within a year and a half, I hit 100,000 subscribers. Which was mind-blowing. For context, this is what that 100,000 people looks like:\n\nSince then though, it’s truly been a wild ride. I started working as a doctor in the UK’s National Health Service in 2018. During my first two years of working full-time, I was churning out 1-3 YouTube videos each week. Along with a weekly email newsletter and weekly podcast that I started with my brother. In that time, the channel grew to over a million subscribers. I expanded my team to include a full-time editor and writer as well. To date my channel has 3.5 million+ subscribers, and I make over £100,000 ($130k) each month. All from YouTube ads and sponsorships. I get to interview some of my heroes (like author Brandon Sanderson), collaborate with amazing creators like Marques Brownlee and Matt D’Avella, and make frankly whatever videos I like.\nAll while putting in about 8 hours of effort a week. Which in all honesty is bloody ridiculous, and I didn’t think it’d ever be possible.\n\nI even started my own course teaching people how to be YouTubers. It’s called the Part-Time YouTuber Academy, which to date has had 2000+ students. In my humble opinion, it’s the best YouTube course in the world.\n The Power of YouTube\nSo, in this guide I want to show you exactly how to start your own YouTube channel, based on my years of trial and error, and from coaching thousands of Part-Time YouTuber Academy students through the process. Here’s how I’ve structured the three stages of your YouTube journey:\n\nGet Going – The most important part: how to actually get started on YouTube.\nGet Good – How to improve your video quality, and grow an audience.\nGet Smart – How to develop a strong YouTube niche, and make money from your channel.\n\nBut it’s important to remember – there’s no magic bullet that’ll net you millions of subscribers within a few weeks. These stats show the average number of videos you need to make to reach certain subscriber milestones:\n\nIf you approach YouTube strategically (eg by reading this guide), you’ll improve a lot on those average numbers. But starting and growing a YouTube channel still takes a lot of work. Especially if you want to take it seriously.\n\n You won’t see much growth, or money, in the early stages.\n You’ll have to get over the fear of judgment from friends, family and strangers on the internet.\n You’ll have to work out what you’re going to talk about + why anyone would care what you’ve got to say.\n You’ll need to learn about cameras, microphones, lights, video editing and post-production.\n You’ll worry that you’re going to run out of ideas.\n\nBut here’s one thing I can guarantee. If you publish about once a week, for 1–2 years your life will change. Often in ways you can’t imagine. By doing YouTube I:\n\n  Unlocked the ability to live and work from anywhere in the world\n Made a lot of new friends and met my heroes.\n Achieved financial freedom\n  Learned to speak confidently to camera\n\nMost importantly, making YouTube videos is a blast. You learn so much from each video. You get to express yourself creatively, and when you hit publish it’s like your little creation is going out into the world. You’ll find yourself improving over time. You start getting messages from friends saying they saw your video and thought it was cool. The likes and comments are wholesome and supportive 99.9% of the time. It’s all rather fun.\n The Fear of Getting Started\nAfter I tell people about the benefits of starting a YouTube channel, they tend to say ‘amazing, I’ll give it a go’. But 90% never do. And the main reason is usually what will my friends and family think?. Before starting YouTube I was worried about this as well. But very quickly, as I started making videos, I realised three things:\n1. No one really cares Everyone is too worried about their own lives to care about what you’re doing for more than a few seconds. Psychologists call this The Spotlight Effect: we all go through life as if we have a spotlight trained on us, with other people watching and judging. But in reality, they’re all thinking the exact same thing. As Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, You wouldn’t worry so much about what others think of you if you realised how seldom they do.\n\n2. No one is going to know Unless you actively tell people or spread the word on social media, no one is going to know that you started a YouTube channel. You could post your book reviews/music videos/video essays for a very long time before anyone you know IRL would ever find out. By which time your videos would probably be pretty good, and they’d say ‘why didn’t you mention your awesome videos sooner?!’\n3. The reaction is almost always positive 99% of people who start a YouTube channel and tell people about it get a positive reaction. This was definitely true for me: friends were excited to appear in vlogs, professors asked me to help film conferences, and my tiny audience was super-supportive of even my poorly-made early videos. And this makes sense. When did you last judge someone for doing something new and exciting? Chances are, if your friend tells you they’re starting a YouTube channel or blog, you’d actually be excited for them and maybe a little inspired or motivated to do something similar. So go for it, and don’t look back \n Notion\nBy the way – I use the amazing (free) productivity app Notion to produce all my YouTube videos. If you haven’t used Notion before I recommend trying it out. Here’s a quick introduction to my YouTube workflow using Notion. But for a full introductory guide to Notion check out my crash course Notion: Maximise Your Productivity and Organisation.\n\nI’ll include links to my various Notion templates (scriptwriting, managing my filming schedule, competitor analysis, etc) throughout this guide. Feel free to use or take inspiration from them for your own system. But remember: Notion is just a useful extra. You don’t need a fancy production system to make YouTube videos. It’s totally possible to manage everything from a single Google Doc.\n1. Get Going\n 1. Discover Your YouTube Niche\nThe most exciting, open-ended aspect of starting out on YouTube is discovering your niche. What do you want to make videos about?\nFor me, there are two main approaches you can take to finding your niche. You can be an Architect or an Archaeologist.\n\nIf you’re an Architect, you meticulously plan everything before even thinking about laying the first brick (ie, filming your first video). You won’t begin your YouTube journey without a channel strategy, meticulous market research, and a filming and editing workflow ready.\nArchaeologists, on the other hand, approach their task through a process of iteration and discovery, not really knowing what they’ll find. They start off with some digging (filming a few videos). Eventually, they see the beginnings of something interesting, and a niche emerges.\nI’d recommend the Archaeologist approach for 90% of people. Unless they have experience already or have a very specific idea of what to make videos about.\nStart creating content and, over time, you’ll find what you enjoy and your niche will emerge. Good questions to ask yourself though, are:\n\nWhat do I love to watch or listen to already on YouTube?\nWhat topics do I know a lot about?\nWhat do I wish I had known three years ago, five or ten years ago that I could help people with now?\nCan I imagine making 50 videos on this general topic? Or would I get bored after 10?\n\nThose questions will set you on the right path if you’re not sure what to make videos about yet.\nRemember, it’s easier to change direction if you’re already moving. I started off doing videos about med school. Now I do all sorts of stuff like tech reviews, productivity advice, and book summaries.\nFor now, the main thing is just getting started. No excuses.\n 2. Create Your YouTube Channel\nYou can find a detailed technical walkthrough of how to set up a YouTube channel in my YouTube for Beginners course.\nBut here are the basic steps, along with a few of my main recommendations\n1. Creating a New Account I suggest you create a new business account instead of a personal one for your channel. This means you can later give more people (editors, collaborators) easy access to your channel.\n2. Naming Your Channel For 99% of people I suggest using your own name. This is super flexible, helping you build a personal brand. And makes people feel like they’re connecting with a real person. You can always change your channel name to something like ‘Binging with Babish’ or ‘Keep Productive’ later down the line.\n3. Choosing a Profile PictureYour YouTube channel needs two main visuals: your profile picture, and your channel banner.\n\nI think the best profile picture is a fairly clear picture of yourself, like this. If your phone has a portrait mode, use that to get shots in a few different locations. Keep going until you find one you like.\n\n\n4. Choosing a YouTube Channel Banner\nNext up you need a channel banner for your YouTube homepage.\n\nCanva is a good resource for this. Go to their YouTube Channel Cover templates, and choose an option that fits your vibe. Again, there’s zero reason to overthink this – you’re just getting started, and you can change everything further down the line.\n 3. Beat Perfectionism\n\nCongratulations, you have your channel up and running! Now you’re ready to make some videos.\nAt this point I’d like to challenge you to film a completely unscripted video on your phone, and upload it to your YouTube channel – with zero preparation.\nYes, that might sound scary. But the whole point of this exercise is to beat your perfectionism. Don’t worry about lighting, audio, or looking stupid. Just record something quickly (preferably in the next 15 minutes) and post it to YouTube.\nThe best option is probably to make a video introducing yourself and your channel. Eg ‘Hi my name’s Ali, this is just a quick video I’m making to introduce my channel. I’ll be posting videos about cooking, which I’ve loved doing since I was 13 years old. I love channels like Binging with Babish and Ethan Cheblowski, so I thought I’d give it a shot […]’\nThat’s literally all you need.\n\nProp your phone up on a pile of books (or hold it in your hand).\nPress ‘record’ and talk to the camera.\nOnce you’re done, upload it quickly to YouTube via the YT mobile app.\nTitle the video ‘Welcome to [channel name here] – My First Video’, and write a short description.\nYou can use a still frame from the video as a thumbnail. Or just take a selfie horizontally on your phone.\nNow, publish the video.\n\nHere’s an example of me doing this for the hypothetical ‘Ali’s Kitchen’ YouTube channel.\nThe point here isn’t to get views or anything. It’s to get over your perfectionism and just post something. I can’t emphasise enough how important it is to get your first few video out there. Even if you haven’t decided on a niche, dip your toe in the water.\nIf it makes you feel better, say ‘Ali Abdaal told me to do this.’ \n 4. Script Your First Video \n\nOnce you’ve published that first first video, it’s time to look at scripting in earnest.\nSome people film vlogs and other video types completely off the cuff, like Emma Chamberlain.\nFor most people, it helps to have a rough plan of what to say on camera. This way you don’t ramble on for ages, have a weak video structure, or get frustrated during filming.\nYou really don’t want to overthink scripting at this point, so here’s the process I’d recommend for now:\n\nDecide on a few simple concepts that you can easily talk about (eg your desk setup). Think of a short intro. Something like ‘I work a lot from home, and my desk is where I spend 80% of my time. So I thought I’d run you through my complete desk setup, which I’ve built up over the last 2 years.’\nThink about what you’d say to a friend about one of those topics (your favourite type of desk, type of chair, lighting, laptop choice, etc).\nWrite about 2-5 bullet points for each of those main points. (Why that desk in particular? Best features? Flaws?)\nWrite a brief conclusion, touching on the most important information in your video.\n\nThis is how I scripted my first 20-30 videos, and it honestly works really well when you’re just getting started.\n 5. YouTube Video Technical Basics \nWhen starting a YouTube channel, it’s easy to think you need a ton of fancy gear and a super expensive camera before you start filming.\nBut, in reality, this isn’t necessary. If you’re on a budget or just want to trial out YouTube for a bit, all you really need to get started is the camera on your phone. This gives you pretty decent video/audio quality and is more than enough to build an audience. But there are still a few important things you need to keep in mind if you’re looking to create the best possible videos.\n i. Video Quality \nYou don’t really get the best video quality with the default camera app on your phone. It’s usually not possible to control all the possible settings.\nSo, the app that you want to use and that most people recommend to sort this out is called Filmic Pro. The great thing about this app is that you can manually control a lot of the camera settings. This really helps to boost the visual appeal of your videos.\nIn particular, you need to change the following settings:\n1. Frame rate – normally iPhones film in 30 frames per second (FPS). This is just a little bit too smooth and isn’t really the vibe you usually want to be going for (unless you like it, in which case you do you). I normally shoot in a frame rate of 25 FPS, which looks far more cinematic. And hopefully looks quite reasonable when using your phone too.\n\n2. Resolution and Bitrate – this sounds complicated but basically you want to film in 4K resolution, because you might as well and most modern phones offer that. And then you want to crank up the bitrate as high as possible too. On iPhones this is called ‘FiLMiC Extreme’ and on Android I think it may say something like ‘100 Mbps’. This just means there’s more information encoded and takes up a bigger file size, which generally means your videos are going to be higher quality.\n\n3. White balance – you want to set your white balance so it doesn’t vary massively.\n\n4. Shutter speed – finally, there’s this kind of rule with filmmaking that if your frame rate is 25 FPS you want your shutter speed to be double that. So you want your shutter speed to be 1/50 of a second. Essentially, that gives you the best amount of cinematic motion blur, which should make the video look natural when you’re moving your hands as you talk. If you cranked up the shutter speed really high (like 1/200), it would look a lot more choppy.\n\nThis all sounds complicated. But once you’ve got the settings sorted the first time, you can save them as a preset on Filmic Pro and never have to touch them again.\nThis video from me explains how you can film YouTube videos on your smartphone. But for now, don’t spend more than about 30 minutes thinking about video quality.\n ii. Audio Quality \nIf you’re just getting started with YouTube, the audio with just your phone isn’t actually too bad. It definitely isn’t the sort of quality where people would be like oh god, that’s garbage, I’m going to turn this off immediately.\nFor your first few videos, this will be fine. I film plenty of vlogs and Instagram posts using my iPhone’s built-in mic. But if you want to invest a bit more, get a cheap lavalier mic and plug it into your phone / camera.\n\nThese are better than using your phone to record audio. They get the microphone closer to the audio source (aka your mouth), giving a clearer result. Search YouTube for Best lavalier mic 202X or best lavalier mic under $100 and you’ll find something decent. Don’t sweat it.\n A wireless lav mic (gold standard is the RØDE Wireless Go II) is great for when you’re moving around (eg: my apartment tour video), but costs a bit more ($260)\nFor good audio at a beginner level, another super-important thing is to create a clean canvas for your voice. Get rid of as many irritating background noises as you can:\n\nTurn off loud air conditioning, fans, or humming fridges.\nAvoid filming in crowded or windy spaces\nExperiment with different spaces. A small room with lots of hard surfaces for sound waves to bounce around on (like a bathroom) will have a lot of tinny echoing. A much better option would be a medium-sized living room with pillows, carpets, and furniture to soak up those sound waves. This will give a cosier vibe.\n\n Tip: if you find the audio is too tinny, try spreading some cushions on the floor, out of shot. This should help.\n iii. Lighting, Framing and Background \n\nAs a beginner, the natural light through your window is usually enough to light your video. Try to record with the window to your side so your face is lit up by soft natural light.\nFraming the shot means getting yourself and your background positioned perfectly, so there’s a nice visual feel to your videos. You want the top of the camera frame to be a little bit above the top of your head, and for the camera to be roughly eye-level (so you’re looking straight ahead at it, not up or down).\nBack when I recorded with my iPhone, I connected it to my MacBook. I used QuickTime Player to share/mirror whatever my phone was recording. That let me use the normal camera on the back of my phone (as it has a higher quality than the selfie camera), helping me easily frame my shot and see exactly what I’m recording.\nAs for your actual background, don’t overthink it – it’ll evolve over time. But it’s good to get some basic principles right:\n\nHave some depth of field (aka space behind you). This will make your videos feel more alive and dynamic, instead of you filming with your back to a wall.\nPlants or interesting objects in the background also add personality.\nLight up objects in the background using lamps or LED strips – these are your ‘accent lights’. Just make sure they don’t shine directly towards the camera/phone.\n\nLooking at other creators’ backgrounds is always good for inspiration:\nPick Up Limes: the plants and homey feel matches her vibe, and the ‘green’ theme of her channel.\n\nNPR Tiny Desk: The channel personalise the background by having one item added to it by every guest artist. Yup it’s messy, but also a signature vibe.\n\nCasey Neistat: He uses his real workshop as a background. Legit, cool, laidback vibes that match his go for it attitude.\n\nThe main point is that you don’t actually need a lot to start a YouTube channel and begin filming. If you’re on a budget you can do everything on your phone and then upgrade later when you decide to start taking things a bit more seriously.\n 6. Editing \nOnce you’ve scripted and filmed your video, it’s time for the edit. There’s an old saying from the film industry:\nA movie is made three times: it’s made when it’s written, it’s made in production, and it’s made again in post.\nAnd this is really true. There’s a whole art to video editing, and it massively affects your video’s whole look, feel, and narrative.\nAs a beginner, the free editing software on your laptop (such as iMovie) is enough to do some basic edits to your videos and get them on to YouTube.\nA written guide really isn’t the best place to describe how to edit though, as it’s such a visual craft. To learn the basics (and lots of advanced techniques), check out my Final Cut Pro X course, where I cover everything from basic footage and A-cuts to special effects and colour correction.\nBut to give you a general idea, here’s my three-part workflow for editing videos:\n\nA-Cut Assembly. Create your project, import footage, and assemble your A-cut by choosing the best takes. Trimming out any silence to make a sharp, snappy edit.\nB-Roll Shenanigans. Once your basic timeline is created, you want to add in interesting B-roll. These could be second camera clips, titles, transitions, and lower thirds. Or even images, screen recordings, and even handwritten animations.\nCoats of Polish. With all the footage added, you want to add in background music to sound more pro, sound effects to your titles and transitions, add vocal effects to your audio track (compression and EQ), and do some colour grading to give your edit the right look and feel (eg warm and cosy, or bright and clinical).\n\nThe three edits that make the most difference are:\n\nTighter A-cuts – whenever we hear a pause in a video it sounds weird. So you want to cut those out in the edit so everything flows smoothly.\nTitles, lower thirds &amp; transitions – these make your video more engaging, easier to follow, and are useful ways to include branded elements.\nSubtle sound effects – Sound effects can massively elevate your production value when used subtly. They make your videos feel polished. I tend to use a sound effect whenever something appears on the screen.\n\n The Next Step \nHaving a YouTube channel is a bit like being in a relationship.\nAnd by this point in the journey, you’ve made a few videos, and you probably know whether you like making videos enough to keep ‘the relationship’ going or not.\nIf the answer is ‘no’, that’s great – you tried it out and learned it’s not your jam. But if the answer is ‘yes’, the next big question is ‘do you want to make this a serious relationship?’ Do you want to move beyond casual dating?\nIf your answer is Yes, I’m ready to commit to this relationship, then the next step is to Get Good at your craft. And it might be the most fun part of being a YouTuber.\n2. Get Good\n 1. Quantity vs Quality \n\nSo you’ve uploaded a few videos to your channel, you’re enjoying YouTube, and you’ve decided to take the next step – to Get Good.\nYou now have an important choice to make: quantity or quality? In other words, will you improve most from trying to make every video perfect? Or from cranking out several decent videos in the same time, aiming for incremental, 1% improvement (quantity)?\nIt’s an age-old question. And for 90% of people I’d say quantity is the way to go – especially if you’re just starting out. You’ll get so many new data points from publishing videos regularly, about your choice of topic, your presenting style, the type of editing that works best, and loads more.\nThe classic Parable of the Pottery Class (adapted from the book Art &amp; Fear) illustrates this point:\nThere was once a pottery teacher called Brian. One month, he decided to split his class into two groups. Group A had to make a pot every day for 30 days (so 30 pots in total). Group B had to work on a single pot for the whole 30 days.\nAt the end of the month, Brian judged the quality of the pots. Without exception, every one of the top 10 pots came from Group A, the guys that made one pot per day. None came from the group that focused on perfecting their single pot.\nSo, in an ideal world, you’d be making a minimum of 1 video per week to start with. That’s 52 videos per year. That could be more or less, depending on how demanding video production is for your niche. React-style gaming videos are super-quick to film. But outdoorsy mini-documentaries (eg Beau Miles) take ages to film + edit.\nThere are exceptions to this quantity&gt;quality rule. Video essayist James Jani hit 1.36M subscribers with just 18 videos, and DIY/science experiment channel Stuff Made Here has 4.8M subscribers from just 29 videos (all with 1M+ views).\nBut these are outliers who put an insane amount of effort into every video. James spends 100s of hours researching each of his video essays, and didn’t publish for 9 months in 2022. Likewise, Stuff Made Here do insane engineering challenges like building a moving basketball hoop that won’t let you miss, which is beyond most people’s expertise and also takes a lot of time and equipment.\nIn conclusion – to get good, focus on quantity, at least for your first 50-100 videos.\n\n 2. So, What Makes a Good Video? \nThis is the next logical question – what actually makes a good YouTube video?\nWell you just need to get people to click on it, and you need to get people to watch it. That’s it! You can make genius videos that get millions of views by screen-recording yourself playing Minecraft, or cooking with a GoPro strapped to your head.\nBut generally speaking, a lot of other technical elements go into making a good video. Firstly, there are several YouTube-specific skills to learn:\n\nTopic choice\nTitles\nThumbnails\nScripting\nCamera Presence\n\nThen there’s the filmmaking component. The more you hone these skills, the better your videos will look and sound:\n\nVideography\nAudio\nMusic + Sound Design\nEditing\n\nYou can spend years improving all of these things – there are whole university degrees focused on editing and scriptwriting, for example. But in this part of the guide I’ll focus on the absolute essential things for a new YouTuber to get right, if they want to make good videos.\nPart I: YouTuber Skills\n 1. Generating Good Ideas \n\nSuccess on YouTube relies on making good videos consistently – around once per week.\nSo the main bottleneck most people come to is the problem of ideas: ‘What if I run out of content? How can I make sure I have enough ideas to make a good video every week?’\nI used to worry about this, but over time I’ve figured out a system that I call the Idea Generation Machine. This means I never have to worry about running out of video ideas.\nThere are two components to this machine – Capture and Generate. And the aim is to create more video ideas than you’ll ever even have time to film.\n Capture \n\n Eureka Moments\nThe most important thing you can do is to have a system in place for capturing ideas from your own mind. If you’re going for a walk or sat on the toilet and an idea for a video (even a tiny one) pops into your mind, have a quick solution for capturing it.\nThis could be an Apple Notes folder, a voice memo into your smart watch, or a notebook you take everywhere. The key thing is to capture that idea before you forget it. You’ll gradually build a list that you can return to when you’re thinking of what to film next.\nI like to store specific ideas in my Notion Video Homebase: The Infinite Content Engine\n  Birdsong Technique\nAs a YouTuber, you should get into the habit of treating other people’s content (books, podcasts, videos) as a source of inspiration. A bit like birdwatchers no longer just hear birdsong – they can identify all the individual bird songs, including the one they’re keeping an ear out for.\nIf you come across an interesting tweet, podcast episode, or newsletter, make a note of it. Include what you specifically found interesting. You can set up an automation on your phone to automatically forward interesting ideas to your Notion if you’re using that system.\nI’ve made so many videos purely based on a tweet I saw (often from Naval Ravikant lol) that prompted some interesting thoughts. So keep your ear to the ground.\n Coal Mines\nAs well as capturing specific ideas, you want to create an inventory of potential websites, social media feeds, YouTube channels, newsletters, and any other places on the web for you to mine for content ideas that are relevant for your channel.\nIf you’re ever stuck for content ideas in the future, you can return to this list. Use the simple Notion template below to create your own list of Coal Mines.\nMy Coal Mines\n\n Generate \nOnce you’ve set up a good system for capturing ideas, you’ll also want a way of generating them without outside input. My favourite method for doing this (which I learned from my friend Sean McCabe) is called ‘5 Months of Content in 5 Minutes’.\nAs the title suggests, it’ll help you create a massive amount of ideas in a very short amount of time. Here’s how it works:\n\nList out the 5–10 topics your audience (or your future audience) wants to learn.\nThen create another list of 5–10 topics you would want to teach. Don’t worry if there’s overlap between the lists – just concentrate on trying to populate each one with 10 ideas. Try to come up with more if you can: as always, quantity leads to quality. Here’s your list of topics right now:\nNow, it’s time to break up each of the 10-20 topics above into smaller points. For example, let’s say I’ve identified a topic my audience wants to learn as being writing newsletters. My first sub-point might be newsletters for beginners. Then, in step three, this could be broken down into should you start a newsletter, best platform to host a newsletter and how to start a newsletter in 3 easy steps.\nFinally, repeat step 3 for each of those sub-niches. You’ll find you have countless things to discuss, so long as you get specific enough. Sure, some might be too niche, but a lot of them will be worthy of a whole video.\n\nRather than being scattered and making content about ‘stress management’, then ‘building newsletters’, and then ‘study techniques’, you could niche down and make 10 separate videos about the different aspects of stress management. And if you did that well, I’m pretty sure your channel could blow up.\nHere’s my Notion template for this exercise:\n5 Months of Content in 5 Minutes\n 2. YouTube Thumbnails \n\nGetting your thumbnails right is absolutely crucial on YouTube. No matter how good your content is, it just won’t get seen if your thumbnail isn’t good.\nThe main job of your thumbnail is to stop the viewer scrolling. You want to stop people in their tracks, and make them think ‘huh, what’s that?’ They’ll then look at the thumbnail properly, before reading the title and deciding whether or not to click and watch the video.\nSome elements that work well for catching the eye:\n\nExpressive human faces. Our eyes are attracted to human faces, particularly if they’re making eye contact with us. That’s why top YouTubers like MrBeast almost exclusively use thumbnails with their face on them, often with an extreme ‘reaction’ expression. Once the viewer sees emotion on your face, they’re automatically slightly invested in your story/what’s happening in the video.\nHi-res photo. You want your photo to be high resolution – poor photo quality tells people that your video will also have low production quality.\nFlashes of colour. Our eyes are also drawn to high-contrast images with colours that ‘pop’. Try to keep things colourful, and avoid bland thumbnails.\nTell a story. Lots of great thumbnails tell a story using the image. A snapshot of what’ll happen in the video. This will create open feedback loops in the viewer’s mind (they see one part of the story, but not how it plays out), which makes them want to click the video to find out what actually happens.\n\nThe most important thing a good thumbnail does is plant a question in the viewer’s mind. You need to awaken their curiosity. You can add text to the thumbnail to literally ask a question/make a statement, or you can let the title do the heavy lifting.\nMost of the titles+thumbnails on my channel are designed to make viewers curious about how their lives could change from watching my content.\nThis style of thumbnail has done pretty well for me, and it’s one you can easily use yourself:\n\nWhat works:\n\nIcons to show lots of options\n$$$ figure on-screen creates interest\nHappy human face and bright background feels welcoming.\n\nI recommend making your thumbnails on Canva. Often all that’s needed is a good photo of you doing the thing you’re talking about (maybe edited a bit in Lightroom to up the contrast), and you can add text or extra images and emojis directly in Canva.\n 3. YouTube Titles \nTitles are the second half of your pitch to the viewer – you’re saying watch this video, not the other 20 on your YouTube homepage.\nHere are my top pieces of advice for writing good titles:\n\nUse language your viewers can understand at a glance. How My Business Made $1 Million Dollars is better than How My Business Grew to $1 Million ARR.\nMake it relevant to the here and now. This is why titles like ‘How to Build a Business in 2022’ often do well – because people can see that it’s very up to date and relevant to the current situation. \nPromise value. ‘How to’ titles are a great example of promising value – they tell the viewer that this video will give them all the necessary information to be able to do a specific thing. How to Learn Basic Jazz Piano, How to Start a YouTube Channel, etc. \nBe intriguing. Some great titles are a bit mysterious, like Nathaniel Drew’s For People Feeling Behind in Life. Make the viewer curious enough to click and find out what you’re talking about. \nCreate tension. A good way of doing this is to introduce a timeframe/challenge. For example I quit sugar for 30 days, or I Survived On $0.01 For 30 Days. \nAvoid false clickbait. Don’t say something untrue in your title that isn’t backed up by your video (How I became a Gymshark Athlete). Otherwise people will click away from your videos quickly, or not return to your channel.\nReveal secrets. This often works well to build intrigue, but can easily become clickbait. Talking about yourself can work, even if you’re not famous. Eg ‘The Real Reason I Quit Law School’. \nBe fairly extreme. People want to be surprised, shocked, entertained. A video called ‘Day in the Life of an 88 Year-Old Man’ won’t do as well as ‘Day in the Life of a 103 Year-Old Cyclist’. Think about the most entertaining or extreme element of your video, and see if you can include that in the title.\nUse numbers. People always like specific information. How I Got Rich is less interesting than How I Made $4.2 Million in 2022.\nStay under the YouTube character limit. Go beyond 54 characters, and your title won’t get shown in its entirety on some mobile devices.\n\nTo write really effective titles, you need to brainstorm a lot. Here’s a list of 20+ titles my team and I brainstormed for a ’How to Get Your Dream Job’ video:\n\nOver time you’ll figure out what types of thumbnail and title work best for you, based on how many views you get.\nAs an educational YouTuber, ‘How to ____’ titles have worked particularly well for me. As you can see from my top eight viewed videos of all time, seven use either a ‘How I…’ or ‘How to…’ in the title:\n\nIf one combination does particularly well, try doing a similar topic + thumbnail + title combination again, but mixing up a few things. Elizabeth Filips did this for her ‘You’re Not Stupid: How to Easily Learn Difficult Things’. That was one of the most-viewed videos on her channel, so she replicated that style twice over the next 4 months:\n\nTaken together, your title and thumbnail make a promise to the viewer: watch this, and you’ll get the thing I’ve just promised you. It’s OK to be a bit clickbaity (otherwise you’ll never get views).\nBut you have to honour that promise, and not disappoint the viewer.\n 4. Scripting \nTitles and thumbnails are crucial to getting people to click on your video. But to keep the viewer’s attention, your video needs to have a great structure. This is a huge topic, but the best way of deciding is to know what structures other YouTubers use most often.\ni. Classic Video Structures \nHere are some of the best, most common structures that you can use.\n  Listicle\nThis is where you just go through the points you want to make one by one. It requires minimal effort and can be super successful. I’ve used this method in a few of my videos. Listicles are an easy way to provide value and structure a video: of you’re ever struggling for content, this is how you whip up a video in 30 minutes or less.\nExample: 9 Passive Income Ideas – How I Make $27k per Week\n  Essay Structure\nThis is what we used to do in English Literature. And there’s a reason we used it – it makes sense and sounds good. You take an intro that explains the issue. You have a body divided into sections that ideally each make a single point. Then you weigh options. Compare pros and cons. Summarise in the end. It’s essentially an oral essay.\nExample: Why I Left Medicine… Forever\n  Story Structure\nThis is the Gold Standard. This is what I wish I could be doing with every video and what I’m aiming for. Humans have evolved around stories, we love them. So if you can turn what you say into a story that follows a hero’s journey, everything will become endlessly more attractive to the viewer. Make what you say personal and show how it has transformed you, and more people will be compelled to listen. A better example of what the hero’s journey actually means is this  video . And if you want to get better at storytelling, get  Storyworthy  by Matthew Dicks, it’ll change how you think about stories and the world in general.\nExample: How Writing Online Made me a Millionaire\n ii. The Four Script Stages \nNo matter what general structure you choose, you want your video to go through 4 stages to work on YouTube (definitely for educational content).\nI call this the HIVES framework.\n  Hook\nYou always want to start each video with a hook – something that’ll grab your potential audience and keep them watching. This is the first 10–30 seconds of your video.\nI suggest you spend at least 10-20 minutes thinking about ONLY the first 10 seconds of a video before you film it. Consider how you’ll keep the audience intrigued enough to keep watching more. This will pay massive dividends.\nTry one of these techniques to create an effective hook:\n\nAsking a question (How often do you really get a good night’s sleep?)\nSharing a fact (70% of Americans suffer from bad sleep… which is really bad.)\nOffering a transformation (I used to sleep really badly, but in the last month I ran an experiment that’s got me sleeping like a baby. Here’s what I did.)\nGiving a tip right from the start (Most people don’t know this – but getting sunlight in the morning in the most effective way to get a good night’s sleep later on.)\nShowing enticing B-Roll to cause intrigue.\n\n  Intro\nThen you move on to the Intro. Once the viewer has decided to watch your video beyond the hook, you need to explain why they should keep watching, and what value you’re going to provide.\nMake this short as well – just enough to set the scene and get the viewer more invested in your video. With simpler videos (like listicles) the hook and intro can be combined into one package.\n  Value\nThis is the most all-encompassing part of the video, and what will keep people returning to your channel for more. You want to pack your video with enough value for the viewer that they’re blow away.\nHere’s how we can define value for the 2 main category of YouTube video:\n\nEducational (eg Ali Abdaal): Wow, Ali’s video was jam-packed with actionable advice – I’ll go away and apply to my own life right now. It was also quite fun to watch.\nEntertainment (eg MrBeast): Wow, that video was ridiculously entertaining and hilarious. I couldn’t help but watch the whole thing.\n\nThe point is to make your video stand out in terms of quality compared to other videos in the same niche. You want your audience to say Wow, they really took time to make this video special – and then subscribe.\n  End Screen Sales Pitch\nYou want to finish every video with an end-screen sales pitch, a call to action for the viewer to do something specific.\nYouTube best practice is to relate the last 10 seconds or so of your video to another video you’ve made on a correlating topic. Take a look at the last ten seconds of my video The 5 Magical Apps That Changed My Life, for example. I say if you want to hear more about how I use Notion to supercharge my productivity, click on the little playlist over here for my top performing videos on how I use Notion.’\nRemember, this is the only time you’ll be able to pitch viewers directly with an idea for what they should watch next. And given that they’ve already watched one of your videos until the end, chances are that they’ll like to watch the next one if you make it seem relevant enough.\n 5. Camera Confidence \n\nBeing comfortable on camera can be tough. It doesn’t come naturally to most of us – but everyone improves with time. Here are my main tips for improving as a presenter.\n 1. Go Easy on Yourself\nAssume the audience are interested in what you’re saying. The sooner you can get comfortable with taking up space, the sooner you’ll start looking/sounding natural in front of camera.\nI find it helps to treat the hypothetical audience like your friends, who you’re talking to over coffee.\n 2. Warm Up\nWarm up for a few minutes before by continuously talking about anything. When you do that, you’re voice and mind loosen a bit and it feels a lot easier to speak on camera.\n 3. Watch Your Speed\nWhen we talk to a camera we often become conscious of how fast we’re talking, and whether or not the audience will be able to follow along.\nThe truth is that you can be engaging with a range of speeds, you only have to think of Morgan Freeman to understand that talking slowly can actually increase how engaging you are. So do what feels natural, don’t overthink it, and get someone neutral (and nice ) to watch the recording back and tell if you’re going too fast or too slow.\n  4. Make Good Eye Contact\nThe amount of eye contact in a video can either make things look really natural or really awkward.\nIf you never looked at the camera it’d be weird. But if you stared at the camera the whole time it’d also be weird. There’s a sweet spot somewhere in the middle. The way I like to think about it is to treat the camera like a friend, and just make eye contact in the most normal way you can.\nAgain, try not to overthink it. As you become more comfortable in front of the camera, it’ll become something you don’t really have to worry about.\n  5. Speak With a Smile\nAlways remember to smile. It helps a lot if you just look like you’re having a nice time while you’re talking, and subconsciously makes you more likeable to the audience.\nRelated to this, it just turns your personality up a touch (whilst still being yourself). The camera always makes people look a little less engaging than they actually are. So you just have to work a bit harder to appear to have a normal level of energy on camera than you do in real life.\n  6. Finish strong.\nWhatever you’re saying, it always sounds better if you finish your point with some kind of momentum.\n 7. Get the Reps In\nUltimately though, the secret is simple: practice. The more you put yourself in uncomfortable situations and stretch your comfort zone, especially on camera, the more confident you’ll be.\nSo, even if you’re the sort of person right now that gets nervous, anxious, or experiences brain fog when stepping in front of a camera, with time and practise this will go away. If you’re still not convinced, go to your favourite YouTuber’s first videos and enjoy the awkward mess that is everyone’s first few attempts at filming.  The sooner you start, the sooner you get past this mandatory learning curve.\nIf you want to deep dive on your presenting skills, and make them an asset rather a weakness, I suggest trying my full Camera Confidence course, where I cover a bunch of principles, strategies and tools for being more comfortable on camera. You’ll also see real life evidence of these techniques in action, as I take various members of my team through the exercises + give them feedback.\nPart II: Technical YouTube Video Production \n 1. Camera \nModern phones have pretty great camera quality, and most can now shoot in 4k.\nBut if you want to upgrade your video quality and unlock more advances settings, you’ll need a proper video camera. My favourite brand for video cameras is Sony. From their lineup there are three main options I’d recommend:\nLevel 1: Sony A6400 ($900) – the Sony A6400 (Crop Frame) is solid choice. It’s a crop frame camera (otherwise known as APS-C) with a smaller sensor, so it won’t look quite as good as full frame cameras (check out this excellent video by Becki and Chris explaining the difference). But it will look a lot better than 99% of phone cameras, and shoots in full 4k.\nLevel 2: Sony A7c ($1700) – the Sony A7c (Full Frame) is the camera I’d recommend if you’ve got $2000 to spare. As a full frame camera there’s a big bump in quality compared to the crop-frame A6400. It’s also very compact, so you don’t need to worry about travelling or storage.\nLevel 3: Sony A7Siii ($3800) – the Sony A7Siii (Full Frame) is the camera I currently use. It’s an amazing camera, but if unless you’ve got money to burn I suggest sticking to the A7c. Check out this comparison video if you’re still not sure.\n\n 2. Lenses \nThe type of lens you use is massively important to your image quality. Luckily, most cameras come with a ‘kit lens’ included, which will be absolutely fine for most things. This is a great video showing how good your video can look with a relatively cheap camera (Canon M50) and its kit lens.\nIf you want to step it up a bit with one of the above Sony cameras, here are my recommendations:\nLevel 1: Sigma 16mm f1.4 ($300) – the Sigma 16mm f1.4 (Crop Frame) is (in my opinion) the best lens you can get for a crop-sensor camera if you’re making ‘sit down and talk to camera’ style videos. I usually aim for a focal length between 16-35mm. I like the 16mm lens because it means I can be quite close to the camera, giving my videos a more ‘intimate’ feel and I achieve that appealing blurred background effect (AKA bokeh / depth of field). The lower the f number (e.g. f1.4) also helps increase the background blur.\nLevel 2: Sony 24mm f1.4 ($1600) – Once you’ve made the jump to full-frame cameras, you’re going to need full-frame (read: super expensive) lenses too. The Sony 24mm f1.4 (Full Frame) is a solid choice, and I’ve been using this and the Sony 16-35mm f2.8 for some time.\nLevel 3: Sony 16-35mm f2.8 ($2300) – if I could only use 1 lens for the rest of my life it would be the Sony 16-35mm f2.8 (Full Frame). It’s incredibly versatile because it can zoom. 16mm is great for vlogging and chatting to the camera and 35mm is great for B-roll.\n\n 3. Lighting \nSitting next to a window will give you some pretty decent lighting. But you can definitely upgrade the lighting for your videos by bringing in artificial lights.\nThis’ll give your video a nice clear look. It’s especially good if you want to film during the evening, or not rely on daylight coming through a window. Here’s the difference between sitting next to a good source of natural light, and lighting myself more ‘professionally’ using my Aputure 120Dii light:\n\n        \t\n\t\n\t\t.slider-info-957.bafg-slider-info .bafg-slider-title {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfont-size: 22px;\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t.slider-info-957.bafg-slider-info .bafg-slider-description {\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t.slider-info-957.bafg-slider-info .bafg_slider_readmore_button {\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ttext-align: center;\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t.slider-info-957.bafg-slider-info .bafg_slider_readmore_button:hover {\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\n\t\n\t\n        \n              \n            \n            \n           \n        \n\n        \t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\n        \n            \n        \n        \nAs you can see, my face is more evenly lit, with less shadows and a ‘light-mode’ feel.\nCinematographers typically set up their main light a little bit off to the side of the person they’re filming. Using a light stand at a 45-degree angle to the camera. That’ll create shadows on the other side of your face, adding a bit of dimension / depth. You can decide whether you want a high-key image (even, soft lighting, light-mode) or a low-key one (high contrast and deep shadows, dark mode).\nWhat you need to upgrade your lighting is a combination of these three things:\n\nMain Light – this is the main engine of your lighting setup, the light itself. This will essentially be a really powerful lamp. Look for one where you can adjust the brightness up or down, so you can customise how brightly your face/subject is lit. The Godox SL60W ($120) is what I’d recommend to most people due to its decent price and quality.\nSoft box. By default, the light that comes out of our LED light is very harsh, so a large soft box will make the light look more natural and flattering. The soft box will also make up the bulk of your lighting setup (the lights themselves are usually pretty small). If you need to light a very tight space, a space light soft-box might be best. But a directional light dome is even better because it gives you more control over atmospheric lighting – so your main subject can be lit up while keeping the background moody and relatively dark. \nLight Stand. This is the simple bit: you need a stand that’ll hold up your main light and soft-box. You can get these for about $20-$40 from Amazon – don’t sweat it, all your stand needs to do is be sturdy enough to hold up your lighting rig. \n\n4. Audio \nSome people say that audio quality is even more important than video quality.\nViewers can happily sit through a low quality video if the audio is good. But nobody will watch if your voice is muffled or unclear, or if they’re getting uncomfortable audio spikes in their headphones.\nSo, as a beginner YouTuber one of the best early upgrades you can make to your filming setup is boosting your audio quality. If you’re a YouTuber who sits down quite a lot (like me lol), one of the biggest upgrades you can make is getting a shotgun mic. This is a pointy-looking microphone that you put on its own tripod and arrange so it’s as close as possible to your mouth (the main source of audio), but staying just out of frame.\nFor beginners, I highly recommend the Rode VideoMicro (about $50), which you can also mount on your camera for vlogging or quick videos. Then you just connect it to your phone or camera using a Rode adapter, which costs about $10.\n\nThat’s a great level of audio for most people, but if you already have the RØDE Go II lav mic, a cheap shotgun mic probably won’t make much of a difference to audio quality.\nThe next step up involves getting an XLR microphone. All the pro mics use XLR (a thick audio cable) rather than the tiny thin microphone ones.\nI’ve used the Rode NTG4+ ($230) a lot, and it has a decent price-to-quality ratio, definitely an upgrade on the VideoMicro. The issue is that most non-cinema cameras don’t have XLR audio input, so you’re going to have to record audio separately. To get around this issue we have the following setup, recording into an external audio receiver with its own memory card (Zoom H5), before syncing audio and video using Final Cut Pro X.\n\nIf you really want to splash out, you can get a pro broadcast-quality shotgun microphone like the Sennheiser MKH 416 (I got one in December 2020). The audio isn’t massively different, but I think my voice sounds clearer with the Sennheiser. It might be worth it if you’re getting really serious about YouTube. Here’s a video I made comparing the Senheiser MKH 416 vs Rode NTG4+ audio.\n\nIf you’ve upgraded to any of the above microphone setups, then you really don’t need to worry about audio any more, beyond experimenting with mic positioning and finding the right recording space.\nCheck out this page for a full list of all my YouTube gear – I try to keep it relatively up-to-date.\n 5. Music &amp; Sound Design \nSo my above advice is about audio recording, especially capturing your voice clearly.\nBut music and sound design is hugely important part of upgrading your YouTube production quality. If you’re just talking to the camera, having a bit of background music is another brilliant way to up the production value. It makes such a big difference to the vibe of your video as long as you keep it fairly subtle.\nI like to use relaxing or acoustic music, which I download from Epidemic Sound – this is totally worth the subscription to access a whole library of copyright-free tracks. Just be careful that you keep the background music at a level that doesn’t interfere with the main audio because then it becomes distracting and detracts rather than adds to the video itself.\nAdding in sound effects like typing noises, transitions, and so on massively also improves the viewing experience, by giving the video a more ‘lifelike’ feel.\nA few good rules of thumb:\n\nB-Roll should include sound effects. If you’re filming yourself making a coffee but didn’t catch the sound of the coffee brewing – add that in post. Likewise with doors slamming, cars driving, or the sound of the sea in the distance. Make your videos feel alive.\nTransitions between footage often benefit from a subtle sound effect, like a slight ‘whoosh’, ‘click’, or ‘bam’. It gives the viewer a gentle endorphin kick.\nAny time text comes on screen, you should have sound effects for typing, text messages and so on, to draw the viewer in. A good example of this is the texting sound effects from Ryan Trahan’s I Invited 100 Celebrities To My Birthday.\n\n So How Do You Know If Your YouTube Videos are Good? \n\nSo you might have followed all the above advice… but how do you actually know if your videos are good? Well, I have two tests for this, which I call the Cringe Test and the Extrinsic Test.\n The Cringe Test \nThis test is pretty simple. Imagine a friend, family member, or a randomer on the street comes up to you and says Oh hey, I watched one of your videos the other day!, or wow, I can’t believe you started a YouTube channel!\nHow much would you cringe?\nIf you cringe hard at that, you haven’t passed the cringe test: you don’t believe your videos are very good. And there’s a good chance that you’re right.\nBut if you only cringe a little bit, or you think ‘that’s OK’, then congratulations: you have passed the cringe test. In your mind, your videos are good enough that the thought of other people watching them causes dread and anxiety.\n Of course, some big creators still cringe at their videos – that’s OK, and obviously not a sign that their content is terrible.\nMost people who start YouTube never get to that point of not cringing. If you’re still struggling with the cringe test, the answer is usually to make more videos and focus on quantity over quality.\n The Extrinsic Test \nAnother way of knowing if your videos are ‘good’ is if they get decent traction on YouTube. These are the statistics to look out for which are extrinsic measures of how ‘good’ a video is:\n\nClick-through Rate (CTR) – This is what percentage of people who were shown your title and thumbnail decided to click\nWatch Time (Watch Time/Retention): This is how long people decided to watch your video once they clicked.\nPositive engagement: good co\nSubscribers: This is surprisingly not as important these days, as lots of subs doesn’t = lots of views.\n\nI won’t give benchmark numbers, because they’ll differ for every niche. But ideally you want these stats to improve slowly over time – that’ll show your videos are getting better from an audience point of view.\nBut don’t focus on external measures of success too much at this point. You want to make videos YOU think are good first, otherwise what’s the point. This approach can lead to more original results as well. Also, you won’t have enough data to go off of until you’ve put out 50 – 100 videos.\nHave a peek at the numbers – but don’t get obsessed.\n The Next Step \nSo you know how to make your videos ‘good’. But now it’s time for some real talk. Is YouTube a hobby for you? Or a business?\nBusiness can be a scary word. If you don’t want to think about YouTube optimisation, monetising your audience, or doing market analysis – stop here.\nBut if you do care about making money from increasing your viewership (which will let you do more of what you’re already doing), then business is the next step.\nIt’s time to Get Smart.\n3. Get Smart\n\nIf YouTube is just your creative hobby, anything goes. Maybe you want to make good videos, but ultimately, all that matters is that you’re having fun.\nBut if you’ve decided to take the next step and run your YouTube channel with the aim of getting lots of views and making money, you need to be more methodical. You need to understand your niche and brand, build a solid production system, and get smart about monetising your content.\nThat’s what this section of the guide is all about – running your channel like a business.\nDon’t forget that this can still be fun: a creative project is often way more fulfilling if you have a solid direction and tangible rewards.\n 1. Understand Your YouTube Niche\nThe first step here is to understand and narrow down your niche. This will help you make successful videos that’ll connect with your viewers.\ni. Define Your Goals + Advantages \nFirst, think about what you want from your channel, and how you can best achieve that.\n\nDo you want a lifestyle business (eg you + one editor) like Oliur? Or a big production team making crazy challenge videos like MrBeast? Maybe you want to keep things small and work solo, while holding down your main job.\nAll of this will affect the type of videos you’ll experiment with making, the creators you take advice from, and how much you decide to outsource (more on that later).\nThe second question to ask yourself is ‘what are my unfair advantages?’ In other words, what things are you fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to have that you can focus on?\nFor example, I was a medical student (‘hard’ to achieve), at Cambridge University (mysterious, prestigious). I had good camera gear and knew a thing or two about making things look pretty. So my videos seemed well-designed and stood out from other medics.\nYour unfair advantage might be really obvious. Like having the money to buy the best gear out there and having sick production value from day one. Or it could be something less obvious, like having a huge collection of marbles that you can make videos about.\nWe all have unfair advantages, it’s just a matter of realising what they are. (I talk about this a lot more here)\nii. Define Your Target Audience \nOnce you’ve figured out question you’re asking here is ‘who’s my audience and what do they want?’\n\nWhat kind of person would value your content?\nWhat would they want to hear?\nWhat are they already watching?\n\nBut remember: it’s easy to try to appeal to everyone. Get specific about exactly who would benefit most from your specific content, and focus on those people. Eg when I started out I gave tips on studying for medicine, rather than studying in general. And that helped me build a committed core audience.\n I suggest using this Notion template to create an imaginary ‘ideal’ audience member who you’ll create videos for. That’ll help you triangulate exactly what videos would help your audience most.\nTemplate: My Target Audience\nFiguring out your target audience’s current tastes and needs is an ongoing process. But you’ll know you’ve hit gold when your views start getting more views, and especially when you get super-positive comments.\n\nIdeally, you want to find that sweet spot where you’re making content that you enjoy, and that your audience also responds to well.\niii. Define Your Value Proposition \nThe question here is what value am I giving to my audience?\nFigure out how you make the most valuable possible content for your audience, using your unfair advantages. You want people to be thinking ‘OMG how am I getting this much value/entertainment for free??’\nA good way of defining your value proposition is to craft two hypothetical intros for your channel:\nValue Proposition (Explicit, ie what you’d actually say) – Hey guys, welcome back to the channel. If you’re new here, my name is Ali, I’m a doctor working in the UK. On this channel, we explore the strategies and tools that can help us live happier, more productive lives\nValue Proposition (Implicit, ie this is what I wish/hope people will think) – This guy Ali looks like he’s super productive, he’s a full-time doctor and does all these other things on the side, and he’s always so positive and analyses tech really intellectually, and his recommendations for books, podcasts, apps, life lessons etc are really good. I think of him as a role-model who I can learn from to be more productive specifically, and just live a happier life generally.\nOnce you’ve answered those questions, you should have a clearer content strategy.\n 2. Competitor Analysis \n\nA key part of understanding your YouTube niche is analysing your ‘competitors’.\nYou need to be familiar with all the other major YouTubers making content in your niche, including:\n\nWhat videos do well for them\nTheir title and thumbnail combinations\nTheir presentation style\nThe video formats they use (listicles, reviews, vlogs)\nHow they monetise their channel (merchandise, sponsorships)\nTheir presence on other social media platforms (TikTok, Twitter, Instagram)\n\nThe point of doing all this is so you can emulate what’s working in the market right now, avoid any pitfalls that other creators have fallen into, and understand your audience better. It’ll also help you spot gaps in the market or improve on what other people are doing.\n\nHere’s a Notion template I made for analysing your competition, which you can add to gradually as you come across more creators in your niche.\n \nI say ‘competitors’ in quotation marks for a reason, by the way. I actually like to think of other productivity/lifestyle YouTubers like Matt D’Avella as my YouTube colleagues instead.\nIf someone’s following one productivity YouTuber, it’s likely they’ll follow another one as well. We’re not really competing, we’re just in the same ecosystem. And the rising tide lifts all boats: there’s a good chance that lots of viewers first came across my channel after watching someone else’s productivity content first.\nI even have a regular Zoom call with other YouTubers in my niche (Matt D’Avella, Nathaniel Drew, Joey from Better Ideas, Elizabeth Filips, etc).\nWorking with others in the same boat is game changing, because you don’t feel alone in your journey. You get to learn from other people’s mistakes, and get inspiration from their successes. And you get constant support from others who know exactly what you’re going through.\n 3. YouTube Analytics \nGo to YouTube, click on your profile picture in the top-right, then click ‘YouTube Studio’.\nThis will give you access to all of your channel’s analytics, including views for different videos, retention graphs, how your channel is doing overall, your revenue from ads, and about a million other things.\nAll of this data is a goldmine for experienced YouTubers. We can use it to perfect our videos, identify weaknesses, and sometimes change strategy completely.\nYou don’t want to focus on analytics too much early days – just get the first 50 videos out. Also, the data can be very noisy if you’re below say 1000 views per video.\nThat being said, here are 4 of the most useful metrics to keep track of:\n\nImpressions Click-Through Rate – Also known as CTR, this is what percentage of people decided to click on your video after it was shown to them by YouTube (either while browsing their homepage or in their ‘suggested’ sidebar). Monitor this closely – low CTR compared to your other videos means that your package of topic, title, and thumbnail isn’t attractive to viewers. \nWatch Time – You can find the watch time for all your videos in the last 28 days, and the watch time for each of your videos. This gives you a good idea of how much your videos are being watched in total. If a video has a high CTR % but low watch time, it’s a sign people didn’t stick around. This could be because they were underwhelmed/disappointed by the content. The same applies for you channel as a whole – increasing overall watch time is a great goal to set yourself. \nRetention Graph – YouTube gives you a graph for each of your videos. This shows how long viewers watched your video before clicking away. The steeper it goes down, the more people left at that point in the video. The grey streak shows your average retention – this video has better-than-average retention. You can use this to tell which parts of your video were interesting to viewers, and which made them click away. Try to spot patterns, and adjust the content accordingly in your next video. \nNew Vs Returning Viewers. This will show you how well your videos are doing with your current audience, and whether they’re attracting new ones. Increasing your ‘returning viewers’ number relative to your subscriber count is a sign that you’re building a loyal following of subscribers/returning viewers who actually watch your videos. Having a low number of returning viewers is a sign that you’re not keeping people’s interest long-term. \n\nUltimately though, your data sample size is so small until you hit around 2k subs that it’s difficult to interpret YouTube analytics in a meaningful way. If I was starting YouTube again from scratch, I’d focus most of my energy on the following (roughly in order of importance):\n\nMaking videos that I like (improving incrementally)\nHitting consistent output (eg x1 video a week)\nGetting genuine positive feedback from my target audience\nCorrecting any obvious mistakes with individual videos that I’d find through analytics (big dips in retention, very low CTR or views).\n\nThere’s a ton more information to dig into with YouTube Analytics. For a full breakdown of how YouTube Analytics works, check out YouTube’s own written guide. It’s super-clear, concise, and up-to-date.\n4. Optimise Your Systems \nThe real secret to producing videos consistently (if there is one at all), is that you need to build a system around your content production.\nA system means that you can efficiently create valuable content that grows your audience and revenue, without it taking up large amounts of your own time.\nInstead of thinking of your YouTube channel as a personal project, think about it like a machine. A machine that takes inputs in the form of ideas and refines them into valuable content that your audience loves.\nTo get that machine working smoothly, the first thing you need to do is quantify your workflow. Make an organisational chart like the one below, and write down all the stages of your current production process, but including the % of time that you’re spending on each stage.\n\nThis lets you to isolate where you’re spending the most time (video setup, editing, scripting etc), and understand where your workflow and operation is least effective / efficient.\nNow you can start to eliminate unnecessary steps and remove friction.\nAnother word for this is ‘refactoring’: the process of changing a system to improve its efficiency without changing the quality of the output. The term comes from computer programming – programmers will spend hours rewriting a program that does exactly the same thing when they’re finished, but running much faster and requiring fewer resources to operate.\nSo, ask yourself:\n\nWhat friction can you find in your system?\nWhat can you do to get rid of this friction and make it more efficient?\nWhat are the 20% of tasks within your system that deliver 80% of the results? How can you redesign your system to focus on those 20% of tasks?\n\nA good example is my YouTube filming setup at university..\nWhen I was just starting out, I kept all of my camera gear in a cupboard, or behind the bedroom door. But that added a lot of extra friction, because every time I wanted to film I’d have to set up my camera, lights, and microphones from scratch. So I decided to remove that friction by having a permanent setup at my desk.\n\nSure, it made my living room a little less cosy, but it meant I could eliminate that\nIf you don’t want a permanent setup, another way of removing friction as a YouTuber is to batch your filming. Pick a day, maybe once a week or fortnight. Maybe if you’re super pro, once a month.\nSit down, and film yourself doing 2, 3, maybe 5 videos at a time. It’s honestly game-changing. This way you don’t need to keep setting things up again and again every time you want to get 30 minutes of filming done. It’s so simple but saves tons of time.\niii. Outsource \nOutsourcing – hiring other people to do some of the work – is the final piece of the refactoring puzzle.\nMy recommendation is to outsource your editing before anything else. Not having to edit yourself will save you countless hours in front of a screen every month. And it lets you produce x2+ as many videos as before (or have more downtime).\n  The question you need to keep asking yourself is: How can I give my customer the results he wants systematically rather than personally? Put another way: How can I create a business whose results are systems-dependent rather than people-dependent?\nMichael Gerber – The E-Myth Revisited\nAs soon as you can afford to, this should be your first outsourcing move. It might take 4-6 hours for a decent editor to edit a 10 minute video. $60-80 an hour is reasonable for someone who’s not super experienced, so you’re looking at about $240-400 per video.\nWhen you’re starting out, the easiest way to find an editor is through a gig-job website like People Per Hour, Fiverr, or Upwork. You can also use a YouTube-specific site like YT Jobs or Editorof. Just post an ad, wait for the applications to come in, and get the most promising applicants to edit a trial video for you (paid, of course).\nIt’ll cost a bit of money, but it’s a great investment to find a decent editor. Here’s a useful template advert for finding an editor, based on my first ad for one a few years ago:\nFinding an Editor Template\nWhen you do outsource, think of it as finding a collaborator as opposed to getting someone to do your grunt work. These people will be crucial to your channel and business’ success.\nSome mistakes to avoid:\n\nNot trusting others with the creative process. You may have a unique editing style, and think that no one will be able to match it. But you’d be surprised by how quickly someone else can emulate your style and create or edit content for you near-perfectly.\nBeing a control freak and wanting to micromanage everything. This will waste dozens of hours a month, and frustrate your editor. Lean into the discomfort of giving up control, and you’ll be grateful that you did.\nSpending too much time spent giving feedback. For the first few weeks, it can be easy to be frustrated with the time it takes to give feedback to others. I find that using Loom is useful, as I can record myself making corrections and explaining my thought processes, rather than back-and-forth over email. Here’s an example of some concise feedback I gave to an editor: \n\nIf you’re interested in diving deeper into the business of being a creator, check out my self-paced course The Part-Time Creatorpreneur. It’s 6+ hours of content spread across 40+ lessons, where you’ll learn everything there is to know about transforming your creative side-hustle into a sustainable operation that’s highly profitable, hugely scalable, and ridiculously fun. Here’s a sample lesson introduction from the course.\nFor something more bitesize, you can subscribe to my Creatorpreneur Crash Course, a free 5-day email course where I’ll teach you the basics of entrepreneurship for creators.\n5. Repurposing YouTube Content \nIn the modern internet age with so many social media sites, it doesn’t make sense to build 100% of your business on a single platform.\nHaving brainstormed and created dozens of videos for your YouTube channel, it doesn’t take much to repost that content across different platforms to get more eyes on it, improve your visibility, and grow your channel / personal brand.\nSome options you have for repurposing:\n\nShort-Form Video (Tik Tok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram)\n\nIt doesn’t take much to cut up your long-form videos into bitesize, 60-second-or-less videos to post on TikTok, YouTube Shorts, or Instagram. These can get millions of views, and drive a lot of traffic to your main channel. You can also film dedicated short-form videos, ideally batch-filming several of them every week or two.\n\nText-Based Platforms (Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter)\n\nAny video that you’ve scripted can be repurposed as a LinkedIn/Facebook post, or as a Tweet thread. Try to compress your main points into as short a space as you can, and pay attention to what works for other creators in your niche on those platforms.\nThe important thing with short form video is that it’s snappy, has great music, and makes people want to re-watch several times. Having a physical object in your Shorts is often a good way of grabbing attention, as in including loops\nTo start with, I suggest picking one or two platforms to repurpose on, and expand once you get the hang of those.\n\nPersonally, I regret not repurposing my content from the start. Since I’ve made more of a concerted effort to repurpose content, I’ve more than tripled my Instagram following, quadrupled my following on Twitter, grown an audience on TikTok and even started a second channel on YouTube for repurposed shorts.\nRepurposing is also important in relation to building up an audience that’s not restricted to an open platform like YouTube. Relying purely on a single platform, if it disappeared, you’d be left high and dry without anyone watching your content. Ideally, you want to build an audience on an open platform (like YouTube). Then bring them onto an owned platform (like a blog and/or email newsletter). This way you’re not solely reliant on the open site.\nRemember that repurposing does require more work. So identify where you can make changes in your current workflow to make repurposing easier. If you have the resources, you can hire third party services to do this for you. For example, some big YouTubers have dedicated Shorts/TikTok editors.\n6. Monetise Your YouTube Channel \n\nThere are the four main ways you can monetise your channel.\n1. AdSense\nThis is the most obvious form of earning money from your YouTube channel – through paid ads. These are automatically displayed on your videos. These are the ads you can’t skip on YouTube. However, to qualify for YouTube’s Partner Program and get monetised. You need to have over 1,000 subscribers and at least 4,000 watch time in the past 12 months.\n Pro tip: get YouTube Premium. If you spend a lot of time on YouTube (which you should, as a YouTuber) it’s absolutely worth the $10 or so to not have to watch ads all the time. Do the free trial for a month and you’ll never look back.\nDon’t worry too much about getting monetised to begin with. The money is just peanuts until you get several tens of thousands of subscribers. Some context: it took me about 7 months to switch on monetisation. Which made me about $10 each day (which I was thrilled about – free takeaway every day). Then after one of my videos went viral a few months later, I started making around $50 a day. This was serious money at last ($1500 every month).\nAnd when 2020 lockdowns hit, that rocketed up to $200-$400 a day (at one point hitting $800). Which felt truly insane.\n2. Affiliate Links\nThis is perhaps the most effective way of gaining revenue from your content as a beginner. By becoming part of programs such as Amazon Associates, you can share affiliate links to products. If people use your link to purchase an item you receive a kickback from that. A significant amount of my income comes from affiliates with sites like Amazon, Skillshare, and products like Paperlike and iQuinix.\n3. Sponsors\nOnce your channel starts growing, it’s likely that you’ll start to receive offers from companies or brands who want to pay you a fee in return for you putting a short segment in your video where you promote their product for 30 – 60 seconds. These deals can be very lucrative, especially if you build an ongoing relationship with a big brand.\nIt can be a delicate balancing act though between, making money from your channel, providing value to your viewers without spamming them, and finding sponsors who fit your brand. It makes sense for me to be sponsored by a brand like Readwise or Notion. I genuinely love their products and talk about them in my videos already. But it’d be sketchy if I was promoting something I know nothing about, and has no connection to my personal brand.\nOnce you get big enough, you can sign with a creator sponsorship agency like Sixteenth. They’ll negotiate these deals for you in return for a % cut, which makes life much easier.\n4. Personal Products + Services\nAfter cultivating an audience, one very broad area you can look at is creating your own personal products. These can include courses (like PTYA), books (like this from Thomas Frank), digital downloads, memberships (like Patreon), consulting services, and, of course, physical products.\nI also partnered with Dbrand to produce a series of skins for Apple products like iPhone, AirPod Pro, and MacBooks.\n\nWith an audience who like, know and trust you, a % of them will usually be excited to buy some merch in some shape or form, to show that they’re a part of your community.\nWrapping Up\nI’ll leave you with three key pieces of advice on starting and running a YouTube channel. Which I’ve gathered from 5+ years of experience.\n  1. Have a Positive Mindset\nHere’s the great thing about starting a YouTube channel: you’re making what’s known as a ‘positive asymmetrical bet’.\n\nThe potential reward is huge. If your channel does even moderately well it can get you new friends, contacts, jobs, skills, and even a full-time income. With a little luck and dedication, it could even make you millions.\nAnd as we’ve already discussed, there’s very little real downside. It takes a big time investment. But even if you never make it big, you’ll still learn all about editing, camera confidence, and building an audience. Practically no one ever regrets starting a YouTube channel.\nSo if you’re remotely interested – just do it.\n 2. Be Consistent\nThe most important thing to remember with YouTube is that you have to be patient and consistent.\nThis is perhaps the single biggest, most non-negotiable, determinant of your success on YouTube. And it’s not glamorous.\nIt took me 6 months and posting 53 videos to hit 1,000 subscribers. That’s months of idea generating, editing, and churning out videos with little to no audience.\nAnd before I hit 2 million subscribers, I was uploading 2-3 videos every week without fail, while working full-time. Things have changed a little now. I’ve got an established audience and have started to expand the business. But I attribute a huge amount of my early growth to my consistency.\nThis was my growth + revenue chart for 2017–2020. There was a long stretch with zero money and few subscribers, until things finally took off.\n\nThe difference between those who make it and those who don’t is giving up during that painful period of no views/income.\nSo if you do start: don’t give up. Just focus on making 1% improvements.\n 3. Enjoy the Journey\nFinally, remember to have fun and enjoy the journey.\nIf there’s one thing that I’ve learned about productivity and success, it’s that these things don’t happen by trying to do more, and pushing ourselves to breaking point.\nInstead, it’s about doing more of what matters to us, and choosing to have fun along the way.\n The Part-Time YouTuber Academy\n\nIf you’ve arrived at the end of this guide, that can only mean one thing.

    "article_body": "In this article, I wanted to share 9 lessons I’ve learned over the past 4 years of being a YouTuber. Lessons that have not only helped me improve as a YouTuber, but also helped more generally in my life. I’ve been on YouTube for around 4 years, and in that time I’ve made over 350 videos, spent thousands of hours filming/editing, and I’ve even had 118 marriage proposals via email. It’s been a really fun, rewarding, and meaningful journey so far.\nIt’s a journey that’s also taught me a number of important life lessons.\n\nHaters are surprisingly uncommon\nNobody actually cares\nGive people value for free\nWhat’s obvious to you can be amazing to others\nEverything is figure out-able\nYou don’t need to be an expert\nThe start is painful\nBring others with you\nEnjoy the journey\n\n\n 1. Haters are surprisingly uncommon\nWhen most people think about the idea of starting a YouTube channel, they think OMG, what about all the hate comments?. But the thing that I realised pretty quickly is that there are actually very few hate comments overall.\nIn general, most people are friendly and have good intentions. Sure, you’ll get the odd hate comment occasionally (and it’s kind of funny when you do), but for the most part people are really nice.\nAnd I think this is a good way to live life generally.\nA lot of us have this thing where we see others with a little bit of suspicion and think oh, this person just doesn’t get me or this guy is bad. But actually, if we really think about it, the world is largely a happy and nice place. So although bad things do happen, you shouldn’t let that stop you from trusting people generally.\nThis is definitely true for me. If I hadn’t made a YouTube channel because I was worried about the hate comments my life would be looking very different right now. And this is the same for every single other YouTuber friend that I have.\n 2. Nobody actually cares\nBefore starting YouTube I was really worried about what my friends and family were going to think. But very quickly, as I started making videos, I realised that no one actually cares.\nAll those people who I thought were going to criticise me for having a YouTube channel and having the audacity to put myself out there in public said literally nothing to me. They’re all too worried about their own lives to worry about whatever the hell I’m doing.\nOutside the YouTube context, there are so many domains in life in which we stop ourselves from doing something because we’re worried about what people will think. Yet, if we just did the thing we’d realise that for the most part, nobody actually cares. Just as you probably don’t care what your friends/family enjoy, they aren’t thinking about you that much either.\nSo take risks and do things, because you’re the only person that really cares about yourself.\n 3. Give people value for free\nWhen you give people value for free, really good things will happen.\nThe idea of providing unbelievable value for free is sort of what the whole model of YouTube is based around. In fact, some people will spend years on end making videos on YouTube, without making a single penny. Although I was fortunate to start making money relatively early into my YouTube journey, it still took me 6 months and 52 videos to hit 1000 subscribers. And another few months until I could even think about monetising the channel.\nIn a dream world we’d all get paid for the value we provide. After all, it’s hard work providing free value for months on end with little or no reward. But, to be honest, the people who are desperate to make money from providing value are probably also the people who think everything on the internet should be free. In other words, they lack the patience to see the fruits of their labour.\nSo the life lesson here is that when you give value to people for free, and stay patient, really good things happen. And only then should you worry about the monetisation side of things.\n 4. What’s obvious to you can be amazing to others\nI first learnt this from my friend Derek Sivers, who wrote this amazing book ‘Hell Yeah or No: what’s worth doing’.\nThe main insight is that when I make YouTube videos I feel like the stuff I’m talking about is just really obvious. This is what C.S. Lewis calls the curse of knowledge – when we know something we don’t realise that there are some people out there who don’t know the thing.\nOften what holds people back from starting a YouTube channel, a blog, a website or a business then is the thought that my thing is not valuable enough because everyone else already knows it. But you don’t realise that actually most people don’t know the thing that you know.\nSo if you just find a way to teach others and provide value about that thing you know (preferably for free), then people will latch onto that because it’s a new and novel idea to them.\n 5. Everything is figure out-able\nWhen I started on YouTube four years ago I had no idea what a camera was. Or what things like shutter speed, ISO, or aperture were. I also didn’t know how to edit videos. I just learnt all of that stuff by following free YouTube tutorials and figuring stuff out using Google/Skillshare.\n\nA lot of people would feel pretty overwhelmed in this situation and stop themselves from even starting. But you’ve got to realise that you can learn absolutely anything on the internet. If there’s something you want to learn, just look it up and there’ll be someone to teach you.\nThis is something that being a YouTuber over the last 4 years has helped me to realise and fully internalise. I’ll now never stop myself from doing something just because I don’t know enough. Instead, I’ll always tell myself I don’t know how to do this thing yet, but I will figure out.\n 6. You don’t need to be an expert\nOften we hold ourselves back by thinking we have to be experts or be qualified to do something. We tell ourselves that in order for other people to listen to us we have to be a guru.\nBut what I’ve learned from teaching medical students on YouTube is that often the people who are the best at teaching us are the people who are just one step ahead of us in the journey.\nThe fellow-pupil can help more than the master because he knows less. The difficulty we want him to explain is one he has recently met. The expert met it so long ago he has forgotten – C.S. Lewis\nFor example, if I’m listening to a medical tutorial from someone, I find I learn so much better if they’re just one step ahead of me because they’ll better appreciate my level of knowledge as a beginner. They understand that I don’t know that much and won’t overwhelm me with information that is beyond my current understanding. If, on the other hand, I have a lecture from a professor who’s been teaching this stuff for 50 years, the chances are they’ll be a little out of touch. They won’t really know what’s going through my head and what my current struggles are as a beginner.\nSo I will always try to learn from someone who is a guide rather than a guru.\nMy advice then is, whatever you’re trying to do, don’t feel like you need to achieve a qualification before you do it. Obviously don’t try to be a brain surgeon without doing the training, but for 99% of things you can dive in and figure stuff out as you go along.\nEverything is figure-out-able and you don’t need to be an expert to teach or to talk about the thing that you want to talk about.\n 7. The start is painful\nThere’s a clip in one of my first vlogs in 2017 where I say that my first 50 videos are going to be terrible. And once I’ve got 50 terrible videos out of the way, I’ll have the necessary skill/knowledge to start making some decent vlogs. In short, quantity leads to quality.\n\nAnd this advice doesn’t just apply to YouTube. It applies to basically everything that we’re ever going to do. When you start something it’s going to be a bit painful as the learning curve is steep and everything you do is kind of average. But as you do more of that thing, you get better at it without really having to try. You just need to push through that initial pain.\nTo give you another example, I’ve started trying to learn how to become a concept artist. And my artwork right now is absolutely terrible. It’s really bad. But I know that my first 50, 100, 500 drawings are going to be terrible. It’s the process of doing them and drawing regularly that’s ultimately going to make me improve and help me become a better artist.\n 8. Enjoy the journey\nFinally, remember to have fun and enjoy the journey.\nIf there’s one thing that I’ve learned about productivity and success, it’s that these things don’t happen by trying to do more. Instead, it’s about doing more of what matters to us and choosing to have fun along the way.\nAin’t about how fast I get there\nAin’t about what’s waiting on the other side\nIt’s the climb\n– Miley Cyrus\nThis lesson really embodies everything I’ve learned from YouTube over the last 4 years. It really is a journey before the destination.\nAgain, taking this outside the realm of YouTube, if you’re fixated on the destination you’re probably unlikely to get there, because it’s in the journey where progress happens. And if you’re not enjoying the journey then either a) you won’t actually do it because it’s not enjoyable or b) you’ll get to the destination and realise that this wasn’t what you were looking for.\nIt sounds a bit hippy, but remember to have fun with whatever you’re doing. It’s the most important thing.\nConclusion\nSince I started YouTube 4 years ago I never expected it would teach me so much on a personal level. And I’m sure over the next 4 years there’ll be even more surprising lessons that this journey will teach me.\nHopefully you find some of this stuff useful and it gives you the confidence to do whatever you’ve been thinking of starting. There’s so much you’ll learn along the way.\nIf you’ve been thinking of starting a YouTube channel (something I’d highly recommend – it’s completely changed my life!), then I’d recommend you check out my live course The Part-Time YouTuber Academy. On the course I’ll teach you everything I know about how to build and grow your YouTube channel.\nIf you enjoyed this article, you might also like my Ultimate Guide To YouTube.
